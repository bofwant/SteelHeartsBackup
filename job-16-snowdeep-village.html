The ship swooped in low, finding a spot away from the building and finding a nice open spot in the town square, the paved stone offering a nice landing.

The group descends using the lines provided by the cave fishers and lands directly in the middle of town before the engine kicks back on and sends the airship into the sky.  Now it was just a matter of finding the client.

The message said the client would wait for them in the local library, it looked like a small and poor village so the library would probably be just a small hut with books.</em> <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="21-Oct-19 01:10 PM">(edited)</span></div>

He took a quick look around the small village in order to try and see where the library would be. He had visited many libraries both big and small and thus he was probably the person here most likely to recognise a library out of the group here. After he did this, he decided to introduce himself to the rest of the party.&quot;

He looked to each person standing there and spoke, &quot;Well everyone I think we should first introduce ourselves. My moniker which I am known by is Carric Amastacia, a pursuer of knowledge and a wizard. I am quite knowledgeable about many things so I hope that my knowledge will be useful on this job.&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Irithriel was bundled up in her pretty new winter clothes. Though they were quite functional, care had been taken to make sure they suited her tastes. As she was lowered to the ground, she felt the cold bite of wind against her pale face. Her snowy hair billowing behind her. But the girl just laughed, the sound an enchanting melody, as she watched the town approach from below. 

“Do you see it, my beast?” Iri asked of Mors, her hand reaching and pointing to all the sites, her happiness and excitement rather evident. “It’s so beautiful! And sweet! And...” <em>Thud</em> She’d reached the ground. Giggling sweetly, she stepped closer to the group she saw gathering together and then curtsied. “Hello,” she said before rising and then glancing over her shoulder, gray eyes searching for her Mors. “I think I know some of your faces,” she admitted, her pretty face darkening a shade or two of pink. “I’m Irithriel Ravenwood.” Again, the girl curtsied in more formal introduction. “Pleasure to meet you. I do hope we all become good friends on this adventure. Right, my beast?” </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Irithriel giggled softly, sweetly, letting go of Mors’ arm so that she could experience this lovely snow surrounding them. The little elf spun around, humming her enchanting melody, while her skirts and new coat fanned out slightly about her lithe body. She was happy, smiling, relishing the small moment. When she stopped her play, she looked at the new goliath. Mors was the only one she’d ever seen, so it was interesting seeing another. Even if he was what her beast deemed ‘a fool’. 

“You’re the second I’ve ever seen!” Iri laughed. “Though you do not state your name.” She tilted her snowy head then, looking at the newly arrived goliath and his pet—she found it sweet that the darling creatures were already taken with his fluffy pet. She looked to Mors then, her beast looking as sour as ever. The girl smiled up at her Mors, giving his arm a reassuring squeeze. “I am Irithriel Ravenwood,” she went on, looking back at the other goliath. “Perhaps you and your pet seek to help in a noble cause. To protect the weak and provide them a safer, happier life. For that is our business,” she said sweetly, grinning first at Mors and then the other goliath. “Though, we’ve a wedding to attend,” she further explained. “But it means we go to the library first! Right, my beast?” she said, twirling around and humming before she leaned against Mors, slightly dizzy. 

Just then, Iri perked up, a brow arching. “Who are you?” she then asked aloud of the quiet girl hanging back a few feet away. </div>

Her balance had managed to come back, so she wanted to stand up on her own. “Mors is right though, a warden might be terribly useful. We could use a man of your skill, if your heart is willing to serve a noble cause.” The girl’s voice was soft and melodic, rather pleasant to listen to. She then turned towards Carric, the wizard. “Yes, we are meeting someone at the library. If either you or...” She turned towards the other girl again. The one who’d called herself Juma. “You.” She giggled. “Could help our wizard friend, we’d be much obliged. Right, Carric?”

Irithriel then curtsied at the two newcomers and looking to each, as she rose back up to full height. “As Mors mentioned,” she went on, turning to place a delicate hand upon her mate’s chest, hoping it would keep him relaxed. Calm. She could sense that unnatural predator wanting to hunt. But this was not the time nor place. “We have a wedding to get to and... to plan!” The girl clapped her hands together and spun around once more, humming all the while. She was excited for this romantic party, hoping her beast might see the beauty it held. 

“So let’s be off! We need the library!” Iri exclaimed happily, glancing back at Mors, her face a pretty shade of red both from the cold and her excitement. “Please, lead the way,” she finally suggested to Carric and the two newcomers she hoped could help them. </div>

She turned to Mors and rugged on his arm playfully. “There were those back in the Feywild who could do such magic,” she explained. “I wonder if that’s how our sculptures were made?” Her expression turned thoughtful and she smiled. 

Iri watched Warden as he started talking to the water shifter. She couldn’t help but giggle, seeing this large brute suddenly get nervous. “Hello, Miss!” she said sweetly, her smile kind and warm.

They finally reached the library, well this fool may be useful after all, He thought about warden, then he noticed the woman talking to them, he had no time for idiots so he would let the others talk with her, maybe if she proved to be useful he would say something so he just huffed and started to look around for threats to his mate. </div>

She’d been intrigued by the pretty magic she was displaying and wondered if she might have an idea on whom they were to meet. The little town appeared to be rather small, so she decided most people probably knew each other... or, at least, of each other. The girl just giggled at her beloved, his sour, yet soft expression just melting her heart and making it flutter. How she loved him. 

“Might I get your name?” Iri then asked of the woman, her pretty face lit up with a smile. “Your magic seems beautiful. You’ve certainly captured the interest of our Warden friend here,” she went on, giggling just a bit more. “As you can see, we are just traveling though, however...” The girl’s expression turned a bit mischievous. “There’s a wedding we must attend. Have you heard of such celebrations being planned in the area? If so, perhaps you might know who it’s for. We are to meet someone to take them there.” </div>

Irithriel looked at everyone. “Don’t you see?”  she asked aloud. “Warden can hunt on the outskirts and get us food for our journey. Mr Carric, why don’t you make a map while we travel. Then we won’t get lost and will have understanding of where we’ve been and are going.” The girl giggled softly and turned next to Juma. “You can definitely ask the local villagers about the area. Even if they do not know Primal Point, they might know something of the mountains.”

Lastly, Iri looked to her Mors, her expression soft and full of love. “My beast, we will need you ever at the ready. You told me yourself you once lived in the mountains.” She moved then and placed her hands in his. “So you will be our great warrior. I trust in your experiences and, well, just you. Though you can certainly help Warden ensure we don’t starve as well.” The girl stood on her tiptoes and kissed him. 

Looking to Taff, Iri giggled and skipped over to her. “And we can get your things in order. Is there anything you need to do or anyone you need to speak with before we head out on this journey?” she asked, her eyes wide and curious, the sweet smile never leaving her face. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="28-Oct-19 09:50 AM">(edited)</span></div>

While she and the others waited, the girl felt compelled to make sure everyone was ready... one last time. Perhaps it was her desire to mother her mate’s young? It was hard to know. But the pretty elf had always longed for those around her to laugh and smile and feel at ease. 

With a bounce in her step, Iri checked in on Carric first. The girl giggled and nodded. “Yes, any map I think will be lovely and helpful. Thank you for helping us there, Mr Carric. Perhaps once back aboard the Steel Hearts you can speak with your friend Carmine Lilly and see if she can help you make the map archive-worthy. It would be the first of its kind and an original in our very own Steel Hearts library!” She was excited that one of her guild mates could accomplish something profound and something she knew he’d hold dear. 

Moving on, Iri looked over at Juma. The woman had just returned from her escapade around the small village. “Did you learn anything interesting? What are the people like?” She would wait for an answer and encourage Taff to join in the conversation. Being the local librarian and all, the elf decided it was information she might find helpful too. </div>

She looked over at her Mors and sighed and then over at the little darlings she found to be so very sweet. With an enchanting giggle, the pretty elf skipped over to them and began to play. “I hope we can leave soon,” she whined, turning her glance over to Taff. “If you’re ready, then so am I.” While waiting for the woman’s answer, she continued her play with the sweet little creatures she’d grown to adore. </div>

Taff finally got out of her daze again, &quot;O-Oh! Yes! I&#39;m ready!&quot; She grabbed her bowl of water and started to walk towards the mountains, she guided the group until they were at the edge of the village, &quot;Uhm we are supposed to just walk around the mountain....&quot; She said blushing, and kept walking hoping that they won&#39;t abandon her. </div>
