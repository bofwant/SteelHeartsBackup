                    <div class="markdown">Selaphiel twisted a fiery lock between her nimble fingers. It was cold—damned cold—even inside. The elven girl pulled up her hood and shivered before leaning against the wood carved table. As her chin rested against her hands, her left index finger found her facial scars and gently traced along them. It had been years since the incident, since her twin had been ripped out of her life. Her parents had died that night. She could still remember her mother’s burbling screams, while face down in a pool of her own blood. Her father had been torn limb from limb, parts and organs strewn about the room. Never had she felt such elation, such joy. In that fleeting moment, she’d tasted freedom. That was until those blue tinted monstrous hands had grabbed her. 

Everything changed after that. One moment, Selaphiel had been in the claws of a beast, the next her brother, Barachiel, had charged the monster forcing it to drop her. The girl could remember watching the creature leave with her twin, her face aching from the claw scratch the thing had given her when she’d tried to save her brother. But she was too weak. Too weak to save him, go after him. But vengeance would be hers and one day she’d find Barachiel. Though most presumed him dead, her own heart knew otherwise. She’d find him and kill the beast that had taken him away. 

Selaphiel had been in Pioneer for a while now. The elf was relatively familiar with the harsh, cold terrain. Though the cold always struck her hard. She’d found clues leading her to the town, having heard of some giants in the area. One in particular donned a necklace. One resembling her brother’s old locket. It was the other half to her own. The large blue-skinned giants had been spotted by hunters and trappers and it was enough for her to want to go after them. If Barachiel was alive... she’d find him. And with help, she hoped to slay the beast that had taken away the only person she’d ever loved. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="26-Sep-19 06:11 AM">(edited)</span></div>

                    <div class="markdown">Efra wearing her newly aquired winter clothes that the Steel Heart Guild was provided and her self repaired Scale Mail landed down safely on the paved stone along side her trusty iron defender Hooch and took a quick look around taking in her surroundings. Even though she was wearing the thick winter clothes over her common clothes she was gifted with during the slime job she still felt a bit cold, especially since she was used to the heat of the forges. She looked towards both Ambrosia and Rini whom also were on the slime job and told them, &quot;Well we better get a move on and meet our contact for this job, this creature is not going to hunt itself and we currently lack the information needed in order to sucessfully hunt it. Hopefully they will also know the terrain fairly well as I am not good finding my way around the wilderness. But I am confident in my ability to help to take this creature down. Plus I have my dependable buddy Hooch with me, right boy?&quot;

Hooch looked up to Efra and wagged his tail. Efra did have some magic of course, but her cantrips were not offensively focused and she only had a few castings available to her. But she did have her magical warhammer so even if the creature was resilient against normal weapons, it would not slow her down. Then she waited for the others to respond. </div>

Selaphiel was with a dwarf.  She knew him well enough.  A brave man.  Strong.  He was a lumberer but he was built that he could carry a battle axe in each hand and probably use a tree trunk as a club if he needed too.  He had fur over his shoulders to keep out the bite and had a lantern in one hand.  He had a stake in this too, and the Overseer of Pioneer had set him to manage it.

Selaphiel was the first one to know about the hunt.  &quot;You&#39;re ready right.  Walls saw the airship.  Reckon thats the adventurers called in.&quot;  He said before seeing the figures walk in from the distance.

He wasn&#39;t impressed, even with the mechanical dog.  &quot;Automatons now?  By the Balin&#39;s Forge.  Even Hunters are getting outsourced.&quot;

By himself he would fail as a hunter and as a hunting aid a real dog would be superior. But he will prove useful in the fight though.&quot;

From the looks of them, she was uncertain if they’d manage the cold of the mountains. The outside was nightmarish when even the inside was enough to make you shiver. The elf pushed back her hood, fiery hair whipping in the wind. An angry scar marred a part of her otherwise very pretty face. “I’m Selaphiel,” she said, giving Rand a nod of gratitude. “You can call me Sela, if you prefer.” The girl reached for the locket about her neck, the pendant glinting softly in the low light of the mountain town. 

“We are after giants,” Sela explained, her slim fingers lovingly caressing the metal trinket. “Not just any giants,” she went on, starting to pace, her golden eyes constantly moving, scanning, observing. “They have blue skin, which you cannot miss. But...” The elf paused, stopping her pacing, as she turned to face the group. “The one we seek wears a locket. It looks like this one,” she said, holding out the pendant for everyone to see. “We need information from him before we rid this town of his filth.” Her voice faltered slightly. “He might have a hostage. My brother. My twin. Barachiel.” </div>

He twists his beard a little as he sized up the women, but mostly the mechanical dog.  &quot;Is he friendly?&quot;  He asked with a bit of cheeky grin.  Seemed the aproacable type.

&quot;Overseer and Gate Lord General thought it best to send a small squad.  Best to track a beast with a team it can&#39;t sniff out.&quot;

He looked to Ambrosia.  &quot;Lass we can get you more clothes.  You&#39;re going to need a bit to deal with these infernal winds.&quot;

Finally he let Sela speak.  &quot;Aye, or something big.&quot;  He said with roll of his shoulder.  &quot;And something with a bit of magic to em.  I&#39;ll show ye.  Scene of the crime so to speak.&quot; </div>

Even if you attacked him right here and now he would not attack you back. He would attempt to avoid your blows as best as he could though. But he is invaluable as my partner though. I can repair him during combat with some basic magic that is usually used to mend clothes or other simple objects like a key broken in half, if any of you are capable of said basic magic then you too would be able to heal Hooch.  Also if he is ever fully broken I can just reassemble him with my magic if I have not depeleted it and if I act quickly enough. If I can not do that though I can just build another one after a good night&#39;s sleep. </div>

But most importantly, she was hoping to find her brother unscathed. Or, at the very least, yet another clue leading her that much closer to him. Her heart had been shattered the day her twin had been taken. A glance at the scar on her face keeping her ever mindful of her failure to help him. But she was older now. Ready. And she no longer had anything to live for. So going all in was hardly a problem. 

Suddenly, Sela’s golden eyes moved to the mechanical beast by the one woman’s side. It was a strange contraption, but would be useful. She gave an approving nod. It would definitely be useful, as Rand mentioned. Her fingers then rubbed at her locket before clutching it tightly in her fist. “So you know some magic as well?” she asked, prodding for more information to better know her soon to be companions. The more she knew, the better and stronger they could all be once they found the giant. Her heart twisted. Barachiel. She hoped they’d find him. “That will be helpful. These mountains are strange. Dangerous. Every bit of skill we can bring to this hunt...” her voice trailed, her other hand raised up, fingers tracing her scar. “The better.” Her expression went distant, her thoughts lingering on Barachiel. Her past. “So, I don’t think I caught your names,” she went on, a soft smile moving over her lips. </div>

I am Efra Havensun, a battlesmith artificier. And my metal companion&#39;s name is Hooch.&quot; Then after taking a quick pause she then talked to the rest of the table, &quot;If everyone is explaining their abilities I guess I should also do that as well. I am an artificier and thus my magic is far more limited than a decicated magic user like Rini over here. I mainly fight using my magic warhammer and Hooch of course. I do have a ritual to detect magic, but I only have a few actual casting available per day. I can use my spells to make one of your weapons magical for the duration, to coat my weapon in fire for a single hit that will set the target on fire. Unfortunately the fire can be put out just like regular fire so in this weather I doubt it would stick. I can also cause the floor to become slipperly thus making it likely for creatures to slip if they try to move through it. I can also embue someone with bravery meaning that they will not get frightened. But as I said earlier I will only use these if I think the situations demands it.&quot;

She then watched and waited for the next person to speak as she reached down to pet her metalic compainion. His tail wagged, but that was only a simple programed response. But being such a contruct had its advantages, it would not become exhausted, become poisioned or be charmed. She hoped that the battle would not be too taxing. Plus if the giant was to somehow die, or other creatures that attacked them somehow managed to die, then she wanted to collect as much materials as possible. So that she would be able to make a viarity of things with it and possible if any materials was rare enough send it to back to House Mancer. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Again, Sela found herself nodding. The more she was learning about these adventurers, the more reassured she began to feel about everything, despite her initial impressions. “Thank you, both,” she said softly, fingers twisting at her fiery locks. The tip of her finger was starting to turn purple when she finally let the deep red strands go, her hands moving to rest quietly in her lap. 

“Your skills will be quite useful out in the mountain wild,” Sela added. “And they’re appreciated.” Her fingers began tracing the angry scars marking her otherwise pretty face. It was obvious she was thinking on something, though she chose not to divulge the matter. For the moment, the loss of Barachiel was her burden. And how she hoped they could find him. “The fire will be especially helpful,” she stated, pulling herself away from dark and grievous thoughts. “So you all understand more about me,” she then said looking to everyone. “I know the mountains well. I track and hunt. The key to your survival besides staying warm will be your ability to blend in when able. I do suggest you approach everything with caution and as quietly as you can. You’ll notice how I stay low and find ways of making myself invisible in plain sight.” She sighed softly. “Those born of the mountains are easily startled and quite unforgiving. As Rand can also explain, giants aren’t the sorts to be trifled with. As soon as everyone is ready, we can be on our way.” She reached for her locket again. “Once more, remember this,” she said. “Locket. Blue skin. Giant. Look for hostages.”

Selaphiel sucked in a sharp breath, as she let go of her locket. If Barachiel was still out there. She would find him. And she’d bring him home too. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="07-Oct-19 11:34 AM">(edited)</span></div>

Smaller, but still big enough, paths of tracks led off from it this way and that about the farm. Curioisly, the trampled snow had so many different markings in it, they would require more than a cursory glance to identify.</em>

<em>Mimi foregoes investigating the tracks, and instead forges her own path towards the darkened dwelling. She would notice that, yes, the door had indeed been kicked in most conspicuously. Likely a wise decision on her part to steer clear. As she approaches closer to one side, she would notice a wide hole, stretching about 3 feet wide from a portion of what used to be wall, to a corner of what used to be a jutting dormer, likely meant to house a coal stove judging by the gnarled, black pipes poking out. Unfortunately, with the moon shining through the clouds, the inside of the dwelling was shadowed over, and not visible without venturing closer.</em>

<em>Efre and Hooch approach the work shed. There had only been one smaller path of tracks leading back and forth from this building. The door, she would notice, was cracked open, only blackness visible behind it; a semicircular marking of where it had been flung open marked the snow below.</em>

It was dark and dank, and heavily shadowed. The girl smiled at that. She had a good rapport with the shadows. Pulling up her hood and covering her wild, fiery tresses, she slipped inside the house, using those glorious shadows as cover. </div>

Off to one side, the dining table had collapsed on one side, a leg missing, and broken, half-eaten plates of food litter the floor underneath.
There was a coal stove, in a dark corner where a small patch of light glowed eerily, courtesy of a spectacular hole in the wall. On the floor, lay a fireplace poker, black and made of wrought iron; it was bent horribly at an angle.

Her twin. Her other half. She gasped inaudibly, her golden eyes suddenly going wide. When they spotted the jerky and hard tack, she immediately moved to pick it up. The food would prove vital for them all in the harsh, unforgiving mountains. Her eyes then flitted to the knife. It was bloody and dirty, but worth taking along, as either an additional weapon or for use in hunting or food prep.

Sela gave them all a nod.

Also found this.” The girl held out the knife she’d acquired. It was dirty, but sharp enough to be useful. 

Clearing her throat, Sela put the knife away and pushed her wild red hair over a shoulder. It was getting colder. She could feel it. Shivering, she pulled her hood securely about her head. “Not sure where this trail Rini found leads, but I can look ahead and report back my findings,” she offered. “Have you figured out what the trail is?” she then asked the Druid. “And what did you find?” she asked both Efra and Rand. </div>

<em>Rand had approached the large collection of imprints that Rini had been inspecting, but lost sight of Sela no sooner than she&#39;d gone. With a sigh and a shake of his head, he continues to observe Rini work, openly impressed at her deductive capabilities.

Meanwhile, Selaphiel moves with feline grace down the lumber path where lay the tracks of so many. Snow had drifted here and there, courtesy of the now steady winds, but luckily the tracks still held up enough for her keen eyes. They had a trail to follow.

Something was amiss however...</em>

<em><strong>FFFROMP!</strong></em>

<em>A heavy thud sounds of from near the eves of the farmhouse. A new dent in the snow, along with the trail of crystals glimmering and tossing about in the air, betraying the fact that a good bit of snow had fallen from the roof.
It was followed by a clamprous rustle in the tree branches just beyond, snaps that grew distant, then quiet.
Rand&#39;s eyes shoot open, and he aims his crossbow haphazardly into the dark forest canopy.</em>
&quot;<strong>What was that--?!</strong>&quot; <em>His fingers rest uneasily near the trigger.</em> </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Efra immediately commanded Hooch, &quot;Sic him boy.&quot; and then closed the small gap between herself and the giant. Glad for the fact that the giant was glowing made it much easier to be able to see and thys to hit the large creature in this snow ridden landscape. Quickly calcuating the best trajectory in her head for a good hit she lifted up her warhammer and focused on the magic within it and swung it at the giant&#39;s leg. She was pleased to both hear the thud of the warhammer clashing with the giant and the vibrations from her warhammer. Pleased with what she had acomplished she gave a quick nod to Hooch. (EOT (Efra))

Hooch quickly sprung up to the giant, his normally white eyes burning red as he opened his mechanical jaw and set out to bite the giant&#39;s foot. Efra smiled as she saw Hooch&#39;s metal fangs sink into the foot, clearly dealing even more damage to the foul creature. After retracting from the bite Hooch kept a careful eye on Efra, he crouched down, looking like a coiled spring waiting to be released. Efra knew that Hooch would do the best he could to prevent his master from getting hit and if Hooch was the one attacked then she could always repair him afterwards.

He crashes backward into a nearby tree, shaking swathes of snow from the branches with the impact. 

The battle, for now, was won...</em>

<em>It wasn&#39;t hard to see what had Rand so harried; the snow was coming down even harder than before, flakes now twice the size, and quite fluffy...Snow and tracking rarely go well for those without a hound&#39;s nose, or a spell, to aid...

The winds have picked up. The snow is falling hard through the treetops, intent on vanishing the party&#39;s means to track their quarry...

The felled hill giant is still eminating an eerie glow, only much less encompassing, near the neck and blue in color...</em>

                    <div class="markdown">Sela quietly stalked over the fallen giant. Quickly, she retrieved her arrows that she’d fired upon him. They all seemed to be sticking out and within reach, so she took back what she could. Once those were away, the elf rummaged through his pockets. It stunk, but she’d seen worse. Turning her head away, red hair whipping in the wind, she managed to pull out three silver pieces—definitely a good thing. She’d give one to Efra and another to Rini, the third she’d pocket for herself. 

“Ohh...” Sela then gasped, pointing at the collar that was suddenly appearing about the giant’s thick blue neck. It was... the penalty. Her golden eyes widened and her heart immediately knew what it wanted. “You,” she said sternly, with purpose. “What’s your name and do you know of Barachiel Rookwood?” She needed answers. She needed her twin. “You will escort us to him if you know.” Her heart pumped hard, her body trembling at the notion of being reunited with her other half. </div>

For a brief moment, she allowed that nervous flutter of excitement take its hold on her heart. But she pushed it away. The girl knew all too well, she couldn’t let her wishes and desires, her hopes and dreams, dictate anything. For all she knew, none of the people Wimpy had captured were Barachiel. But knowing he had men back in his cave was enough. 

Thumbing her locket, Sela just nodded curtly. “Then you’ll start by taking us to your cave,” she said, heart racing. “But I want Barachiel!” She was also quite frustrated and just oh so missing her brother. The guilt she’d felt over the years had become unbearable. It didn’t help that these strange figures wearing black hoods seemed to be tailing her. But she couldn’t think on that now. Now was the time to get ever closer to finding her twin. </div>

Rini instructed the others to make a nest of blankets in the nook.  She lit the fire with a palm full of summoned flames, giving it little puffs to nurse to a merrily cracking warmth.  

Finally the redhead ordered everyone stripped or to strip nude.  They ll bundled up inside the blankets in front of the fire, cuddling those who&#39;d been overcome by the cold share their living warmth--and the fires. </div>

Across the way, she saw the fire, the thing a smoldering glow of red hot embers. It was warm and toast, pleasant.

Sela began scanning the area for her things, the sky still dark, though thankfully the snow had stopped. She could hear the low and rumbling snores of the giant, that beast still under their control. For now. Pursing her lips, she finally found her clothes, warm and dry, and began putting them back on. The sooner they all moved, the sooner she might find Barachiel.

We are lucky to have you and your companion here along on this journey.” The elf’s expression went a bit somber. “Truth be told,” she started, hesitating just a little. “I’m searching for my brother. My twin. His name is Barachiel.” The girl could feel her eyes sting a bit, so she paused briefly to regain her composure. “He was taken by some giants. Clues have led me here.” With a soft sigh, the red head held out her locket for Efra to see. “My brother wore the mate to this when he was taken,” she explained. “We shared special lockets that matched.” The elf blushed. “Anyway, rumors mentioned something like it, so that’s why I’m here and why we are going to this cave. I... I hope to find my brother, or clues getting me closer to doing so.” The girl’s eyes went back to the kitchen knife. She wondered how fresh the blood was. If it was giant or animal... or something else. Perhaps Rini might know and could look when she awakened. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="07-Nov-19 09:29 PM">(edited)</span></div>

And now a group was probably nearby. She looked over at the giant. At least they’d have his aid should something occur. The giant had no choice. Her eyes moved to his collar, though it still did nothing to provide the girl comfort. 

As the others stirred, Sela turned to face everyone. “I... I have a concern,” she began, holding the knife out for the others to inspect. “This blood. It’s troll blood. And it’s rather fresh. I got this from the house we’d looked over yesterday, so it means there’s probably a group nearby. We must be watchful and ready. Do any of you know anything about trolls?” she asked, hoping somebody did. </div>

Being able to use Dodo&#39;s weakness against him would be useful and Efra was able to channel magic into her weapon to create a viarity of different damage types. Thinking about it carefully Efra figured out that burn juice must refer to acid as it often came in liquid forms and did cause burns, different to fire but still a burn. Well at least she now knew what damage type to choose when she cast that spell on her warhammer. Hopefully she would be able to continue concentrating on it if the troll managed to hit her, which it probably would if she was the only one able to exploit it&#39;s weakness. Of course she would share this information with the rest of the group, but she thought it would be best to wait until they set off so that she could quietly inform them without Wimpy noticing. </div>

Heaving a soft sigh, she adjusted her pack and then her boots and readied herself for the trek to the caves. Her mind wandered to this Dodo, Wimpy had mentioned. Did he mean fire could no longer hurt this troll? She needed to make sure. And she wondered if the giant might know what actually did...

“So, Wimpy,” Sela began, trying her best to smile. Though the giant was under penalty, she didn’t want to have to ask too many questions to get a simple answer, nor did she want her plan to be overly obvious to the massive creature. This had to be the performance of a life time! “Your friend Dodo cannot be hurt by fire?” she asked. “What a lucky thing, if this is true! I bet nothing can hurt him then. Can it?” She hoped this would be enough to get Wimpy telling them more. </div>

Perhaps one of the others—maybe Efra—would know for sure. Regardless, it did mean fire was no longer an option. She only had her bow... and her rapier. By all that was holy, she hoped it would be enough. But there was also this little blue. Why didn’t this giant wish to discuss him? Was he terrifying? There had to be a reason and they all needed to know it. 

Eying the collar wrapped about Wimpy’s thick neck, Sela just nodded. Her red hair looked like a fiery sunset, a contrast to the soft colors of sunrise desperately trying to peek through the pearly gray snow clouds. “Yes, you do, Wimpy. Tell us everything you know about Little Blue. Even the things you don’t wish to share. We are all quite interested. Perhaps we can also help you.”

It was a half truth. Sela had no love for this giant. He’d tried to kill them and he possibly knew more about her Barachiel. But with that collar, he was their ally. So good favor meant when all was over he might leave them alone. “So? Please tell us.” </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Sela nodded. Acid. Efra confirmed her suspicions and she was grateful for it. Unfortunately, the red headed elf had no means of dealing acid damage herself. Though, perhaps she might be able to provide some potential distractions that might seem like acid was being used. It was merely a trick of the senses, a means to buy time. But nothing more. Her arrows and rapier would have to do there. Unless there was a way to dowse her weapons in acid if only for a short time. But given the way of things, that seemed very doubtful. 

“I have very little magic skills,” Sela admitted. “Though I can create small illusions. If it helps to distract, perhaps I can trick him into thinking he’s being burned by acid. It wouldn’t do much nor would the sensation last long. But it might be enough depending on how things go.” The girl sighed heavily. “I will just have my bow and my rapier,” she said. “I’m unsure how effective they will be on their own though I will certainly try. If anyone has a means to coat my rapier or arrows, then I am unable to hurt anything with Wimpy’s so called ‘burn juice’.”

The trek was as expected, as they all followed the giant. But Sela did have more she wished to share. “One thing I do know about giants,” she said. “They respect strength and most seem to organize their societies by it. Though, I’m not wholly certain if Wimpy does or not. I just hope he is willing to aid should the time come. That penalty won’t last forever.” </div>

She decided moving might trick his senses a little, as it was obvious he could smell their scent. Bow in hand, her golden eyes rested on that locket... Barachiel’s locket. She licked her lips, eyes narrowing into slits, as she noted his tone, expression, even his mannerisms. The troll wasn’t lying. The elf tilted her head, fiery locks, falling to one side. Odd that a troll as strong as Dodo had no intention of hurting them. 

Biting the inside of her cheek, Sela eventually tasted the blood. She shut her eyes tightly and then let them go wide. This was a risk. But it was worth it. It was for Barachiel. Breathing in and out, she dared a step forward out of the brush. She held up a hand attempting to indicate that Efra and Rini hold off for the moment at least. She needed to talk to this Dodo. Just where did he get this locket?

“Then we promise not to hurt you,” Sela said, revealing herself near the crates—crates she wondered if she might be able to pry open later with her crowbar. At the very least this would hopefully take the troll’s attention off her friends hiding in the tree line. “That trinket you wear. How did you come upon such a fine piece?” she then asked, hoping for more clues... more answers. </div>

Maybe it could still give her friends an advantage if she managed to keep him distracted. Her golden eyes noted the crates and even the bag from earlier once more, but most of her attention was directed to the troll... and that locket. She glanced at Wimpy, that collar still glowing about his neck. He wouldn’t harm them. He couldn’t. His penalty was still in effect. 

For a brief moment, Sela worried when Dodo gave the order. But her eyes narrowed and she held out her own locket, still about her neck—for Dodo to see. “Answer me, Dodo,” she said more forcefully. “That locket. It matches mine. Where’s Barachiel?” Her voice nearly faltered at the mention her brother, her twin. She missed him so much. She longed to be reunited again, they way they were supposed to be. 

“Did he give that to you or did you take it?” Sela was frustrated, her blood roiling with raw emotion. She then looked to Wimpy. “Where’s Little Blue?” She recalled how both he and this Dodo feared him. Perhaps he’d be easier to reason with. Or, so she hoped. </div>

<em>Off near the mean fire, Wimpy was still twitching and jerking. Dodo would trace his claw over to the chain of Sela&#39;s necklace and lift it enough to see.

Dodo&#39;s indignant rage would subside, if only slightly, and he seemed to sink into his thoughts for a moment, before looking over his shoulder at Wimpy.

The penalty collar was indeed still present on the giant&#39;s throat, however, it seemed to be pulsating, growing dim to normal and back again. Dodo turns to look at Sela, and moves backward a pace, releasing the necklace besides. He motions to the hill giant with a jerk of his head.</em>

It was hot and heavy and made her pine for the one she’d lost—her twin. The elf then looked at Wimpy, her expression softer than it had ever been. His penalty collar was still glowing, the beast’s face contorting strangely, while he both looked and listened. He knew something. They both did. “I just want my brother,” she went on, her fingers finding the locket against, as it rested against her chest. “So stop ignoring me and let me speak to Little Blue.” It was all she could do to stay calm, the girl’s insides tense and twisting, as fear gripped her heart that she might never see her twin again. “Wimpy,” she then said. “Please tell Little Blue I need to speak with him. It’s important. Please.” She could feel tears threatening to form, but she’d be damned to let anyone there see her cry... not until she and her brother were safe, that was if she ever saw him again. </div>

There was something strange about the fog, just as there was with Dodo’s appearance and Wimpy’s sudden behavior. They were indeed in the mountains, but it was far too cold for this sort of cloud cover to swirl about the ground, as it was just then. Looking over at Wimpy, his collar fallen to the ground, she frowned. 

“Completed?” Sela said, clearly confused. “How is this possible? You’ve not brought me to either Barachiel or Little Blue!” Her face contorted slightly, her confusion only growing. “You need to show me them. Why aren’t they here? Where are they?” The elf glanced around, her eyes just barely catching the sight of Efra, Rini and Rand in the tree line. “Blue? Little Blue?” she called out. “Barachiel? It’s me... Selaphiel...” </div>

Once again, she glanced in the direction where her friends were hiding and no doubt at the ready should things suddenly go badly. Looking over at both Wimpy and Dodo, she decided that they’d most likely stay put. For now. Turning to watch the fog, she tried to follow the voice. “Barachiel?” she asked aloud, unsure if this was truly her twin or some trick. 

Could this really be her Barachiel? The brother who’d protected her. The brother she’d lost and had devoted her life to find. Sela moved her hand to touch her hair, the back of her neck. If he was there, then he’d been close. So close. But why wouldn’t he show himself or show her that familiar affection she missed—comforting the other when their parents’ took out their rage on them both? Was he angry or hurt? 

“I would never if I can help it...” Sela whispered, meaning it all. The red headed elf glanced everywhere, her golden eyes following the strange mist. “Please, Barachiel...” she pleaded. “I miss you. Show yourself to me...” </div>

Her golden eyes took in the sight of the unconscious Dodo and the cowering Wimpy. Though she wasn’t typically fond of such beasts, they hadn’t hurt her brother and it was obvious that they were just terrified. 

Without further hesitation, Sela reached out for that familiar brush of the dragonmarked. Her body was swallowed in shadow and she instantly used it to her advantage. The girl ran back to the brush where she and her friends had been hiding. She aimed her arrow and let the thing fly, it’s target—Little Blue. When the arrow struck true, she knew her location had been revealed, so she called out to Wimpy. 

“Don’t worry, Wimpy. We’re here to help you and Dodo too. I promise!” Sela meant every word. She couldn’t let this go, especially with her brother’s life on the line as well. She hoped her words hit home with Efra, Rini and Rand... the little band still safely hidden in the brush. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Sela’s eyes watched Rini light Blue up with emerald flame. The elf smirked knowing this would give her and the others a very strong advantage. As she readied herself to move, her sights set on the nearby campfire, she then watched first Efra and her companion, followed by Rand, attack that horrific beast from her past. She swallowed hard, listening to Blue’s shrieks coupled with Dodo’s snores, and quickly made her way towards that fire. 

Once situated, Sela eyed Blue, her red hair whipping slightly in the wind. “We’ll get him, Wimpy,” she said, now standing beside the cowering giant. “You’ll never have to be afraid of him again.” At that, the girl let her arrow fly, once more watching it strike true. She smiled a little, but it wasn’t over yet. Without further hesitation, she pulled out another arrow, this one she held in the campfire’s flames, watching the end spark to life with a bright orangey-red burst. Perhaps a little fire might help the next time.

As Sela’s arrow was being prepared, she noticed the bag near Blue had opened. A few bottles had rolled out, the contents of which seemed rather odd. If only she wasn’t so far, she might be able to better tell or at least read the label. But she could not. Getting her fire arrow aimed and ready, her golden eyes focused on that strange glittery red liquid. Just what was it? And why would this oni have it? <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="18-Nov-19 11:14 AM">(edited)</span></div>

Since she had time to plan the attack, her calculations were true and she hit the oni once again, magic flowing from the warhammer into the oni casuing more damage than what Efra&#39;s strength would normally allow. After this was done Hooch once more followed his master&#39;s command and ran up next to Efra and the oni and lunged out in order to bite the other leg. Thanks to the glow from the faerie fire, he was able to hit his mark and deliver a bite to his other leg.

But better this than death, the idea made her heart ache. 

Suddenly, Sela turned hearing Rand mutter and curse about the crates. The elf gasped, her blush deepening. She’d almost forgotten, though now with everything sorted... for the most part... they could explore as able. She looked back at her twin, her hand moving to his face again. “I’m going to check out the crates,” she explained. “Come with me.” She gave him a smile and offered her shoulder to lean on. If he took it, she’d lead him towards Rand. “I can help,” she then offered, pulling out a crowbar. </div>

After looking at the crates a bit, her cheeks reddened and she actually giggled. “Ohh...” she said, still giggling. The girl then put her crowbar away and moved to flip the latch, easily opening the crates. Before looking inside, she picked up one of the fallen bottles and looked at Barachiel. “Any idea what this is?” she asked him and then moved to peer inside the crates. </div>

<em>Rand does his best to console Barachiel, who nods along solemnly before taking hold of Sela, carrying what he could, like Rand, and following along down the trampled path. The farm family would occupy all the space in the middle on the march back to town...

The walk back was quiet, and uneventful. Some water dripped from icy branches as the sun&#39;s rays coated the forest, and a few songbirds supplemented. But eventually, they all did reach town, the hum of the Steel Heart could be heard not too far from here. Inside the town proper, Rand would turn to the party, and the farm family would head off for their own destination, echoing their thanks as they went.</em>

&quot;<strong>Your evac point is just over there. Take care, all of you. You two especially.</strong>&quot; <em>Rand looks to the twins, a smile curling his moustache, then waves them all off. Pioneer was safe again, for a time...</em>
