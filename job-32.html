Despite being on the army for several years he was not the best at planning a strategy and no matter how long he looked at the map he couldn&#39;t think of anything useful, so he just sighed and raised his head to look at the others. &quot;We need to decide where to land first so we can plan how are we going to take Mister Crow out of there.&quot; He said while touching the place on the map where Jericho was hiding.

&quot;From what he told me before, the rebels are angry because they were conquered by Denoxia, so as long as we just appear as we are, mercenaries, then there shouldn&#39;t be any issue while we reach the hideout. A cart might be useful, specially if any of us gets injuried on the way back but to travel there it would just slow us down... I&#39;m Bofwant, the onboard healer.&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Sela peered around Bofwant, as he looked at the map. She pursed her lips into a fine line, her golden gaze scanning as many details as possible. While looking at the map, her ears listened in on the conversation, the men trying to decide if it was worth bringing along a cart or not. When they mentioned languages, she felt her cheeks grow hot, embarrassment consuming her slowly. The red head only knew Elvish and Common, though she’d managed to pick up Thieves’ Cant once leaving her home in the Feywild in search of her brother. 

“I don’t know much about Denoxia or the man we’re looking to extract. But I’ll do my best and help as able.” Sela moved forward slightly, her eyes finding Bofwant before moving to the others in the guild. “As far as languages,” she went on. “I speak Common, Elvish, and Infernal.” She paused then, her mouth suddenly going dry. “And I know Thieves’ Cant.” She wondered if anyone else knew the strange tongue of the rogues. It wasn’t something she got to speak all that often, especially since boarding the Steel Hearts. 

“What do we know about the border between Eire and Denoxia? Is there a settlement there? Perhaps we can make arrangements to regroup there once we’ve escorted our quarry and wait to be picked up? Maybe while we venture forward we can have someone prepare a cart or anything else we might need upon our return?” Sela suddenly stepped back, her eyes moving to stare at the ground. She suddenly felt like she’d been droning on about something she didn’t know or understand, coming off as silly and foolish. Clamping her eyes shut, she remembered those times when her mother had chastised her, making her feel worthless and insignificant. Nothing more than trash. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="27-Mar-20 10:18 PM">(edited)</span></div>

General, you know the area best. What&#39;s our most efficient route?&quot; </div>

The elf glanced at the orc and then the lizard, remaining quiet as she listened to them both. She then turned to Bofwant and lastly, the raven. She hoped this whole mission went over successfully for them all. “Yes,” she said softly. “I agree. Efficiency is what we should strive for. And...” Her voice trailed a moment. “And the least bloodshed.” 

After she spoke, Sela turned towards the lizard calling himself Vit. “I am also a scout,” she explained. “So if we need to follow a trail or use stealth, I hope my skills prove useful. I’ll certainly do my best.” </div>

He was about to say something but stopped when they started talking again. &quot;Yes, we will need eyes to be alert because I&#39;m almost completely sure that one way or the other we will have to fight the rebels.&quot; He started after Sela finished speaking again, keepen an eye on her while also addressing the other two. &quot;I&#39;m too slow to be stealthy and I&#39;m sure that Mister Crow would be with us if he was good at blending with the shadows. But what I can do is be a decoy in case we need it. It&#39;s a standard strategy in these kind of situations and Sela and I had some experience working like that.&quot; He said referring to the practice they had on the training hall.

Then he turned and pointed towards the map again, &quot;Don&#39;t matter where we land, the only thing what we have to do is not being seen. We shouldn&#39;t let the rebels associate the Guild with Denoxia so early into the mission, that will just give them more time to deal with us while we extract the general from his hiding place.&quot; </div>

Her skin flushed a pretty shade of pink, while her entire body suddenly felt hot. Averting her golden gaze, she remembered what happened after that exercise. How the pair had not only fought well together, but had an undeniable connection as well. The two had succumbed to the inevitable, sharing their bodies along with their hearts. The man had become the center of her world—lover, mentor, and so much more. 

“Myself and Vit can make sure everyone knows what’s coming,” Sela then said, a hand moving to tug on a sunset red lock. “I think the two of us will be helpful there.” She looked to Bofwant then and smiled, edging closer to him while she allowed herself a moment to become acquainted with the others. </div>

&quot;I am fortune to have a set of mercenaries of your skillset. I appreciate the hesitation towards your approach, of course. However, in my humble opinion with the intelligence I&#39;ve gathered, I do believe the settlement marked &quot;Unknown Village&quot; should be safe...enough.

She looked up into his eyes then, her own promising that she’d do her best to make sure no one was severely injured. Not if she could help it. 

The girl understood how battles of any sort could be. Sela had dedicated a fair portion of her life hunting down her twin, fighting monsters of all sorts. Running. Endless running. She’d no time for others then, a dark time. A dark past. But now she was with allies. Her love. People depending on her. She learned that when she’d managed to get her brother and temporarily break his curse. 

“I’ll make sure no one gets hurt,” Sela promised. “I have my bow and thanks for the kit.” At that, she blushed and looked at everyone. “Hopefully we won’t need to use it,” she added. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Sela tilted her head slightly and frowned. She didn’t recognize the flags either. In fact, she wasn’t even sure if they were of Eire or of Denoxia. But a lifetime in the Feywild and then making your sole purpose to retrieve your abducted twin could render one clueless in such things on the material plane. Given this, she decided it best to err on the side of caution. Her gut rarely let her down in that regard. With a soft swallow, she let her golden gaze fall on busier things dotting their path. The village they approached seemed to be teeming with firbolgs and tortles. She’d seen her share of strange beings, but these weren’t familiar to her. Then, her time in the material plane had been only in the mountainous regions of Eire. 

“I don’t recognize them either. I think we should just keep alert. And let the actions and manner of these people tell us the rest.” Sela glanced over at Bofwant and smiled a little, her cheeks quite pink. Looking away, she tried taking note of the residents, their shops (if any), and what they all might be actually doing. “If we plan to get a cart,” she then whispered to whoever from their group was nearby. “Perhaps we should figure out who is most approachable. That aside, we will need to come back through here. So we should ensure our path will be clear and easy,” she suggested. </div>

Pursing her lips slightly, she didn’t want to make the woman uncomfortable. So she moved closer to her love and whispered. “Where do you think they are from then? Do you think it might be a problem moving back through here once we find that General?” She also wondered if they might want to speak with others, perhaps see if there was a local market or tavern where people might be a little more forthcoming with information before they headed out. </div>

She was concerned about how dangerous it would be to escort their charge back to the airship. The girl figured it might be helpful to use the bit of magic she knew as a first line of defense—making the General invisible. She could hold the spell for an hour, so long as her concentration was not broken. But they’d need a back up just in case, the girl didn’t want to forgo an alternate plan. 

“I’m worried that bringing a Denoxian General through that village will cause problems,” Sela offered up, once out of earshot of the villagers. “I can make him invisible, if everyone agrees this might help. But...” She paused a moment, her mouth going dry. “It does require my concentration.

When Mister Krow recruited me and gave me the mission details, I managed to get some small pieces of information that now I realize are very important.&quot;

He adjusted the grip on his shield and took a deep breath, being sure to make eye contact with each one of them. &quot;Sela&#39;s plan of turning the general invisible while we go through the village again is a good one but there&#39;s a catch.&quot; He said and pointed towards the mountains that were just ahead, &quot;Look at those mountains, there&#39;s plenty of places for a rebel force to be hiding around there or have some people keeping watch. The general said that he was hiding because he was sure that assasins from the local rebel forces were looking for him, he also said that he was the one that conquered some the last territories that Denoxia adquired. That, combined with what we just found about that village makes me be almost completely sure that there is no chance that we can smuggle him out like we planned...

Besides, she’d fought monsters time and again to save her brother. She’d make sure to give it her all against any assassins that wanted to do them all harm. 

“But we can try to hide the General for as long as possible,” Sela added. “I think that might aid our cause. Perhaps if I walk with the General at the back, Vit can stealth at the front and warn us if anyone is about.” The girl looked to everyone to see if they approved of the idea. “In the mean time, let’s make some headway.” At that, she slowly edged towards the path that no doubt led to their target. </div>

Now, with help in both positions—decoy and sniper—she definitely knew they’d have a very good chance at success. 

“Bofwant and I trained this way back on the airship,” Sela further explained. “We managed to take out several bandits.” The girl smiled then, her cheeks darkening to a nice rosy red. “I’m fairly good with my bow and hiding is something I’m good at.” </div>

When he headed towards the little group, her eyes immediately snapped to them, taking in whatever it was she could. She wasn’t particularly trusting of them, seeing one hide what appeared to be a flag... were they a rebel? Eireans? It was difficult to say, but the way they moved to hide it while the clearly Denoxian flags flew above was enough to set the girl on edge. Her thoughts then moved to her bow and anything else in her arsenal that might prove helpful given the current situation. But for now, she’d only speak when necessary and any talk of generals was out of the question. What those soldiers didn’t know, wouldn’t hurt them.

Even got more suspicious when the human took out his weapon and spoke those words. &quot;We don&#39;t care about Denoxia... We are just passing through this region. But. As a watcher, I took a sacred oath to protect the innocent, and if what my friend here said is true, then I&#39;m even more curious.&quot; He said, very slowly so they all could listen to him. &quot;You said that you are running. From Denoxia. That you don&#39;t feel safe there anymore, then why have their flags? why are you loyal to them?&quot; He asked but before an answer could be given to him, he kept speaking. 

&quot;There&#39;s two options that I can think would make sense of this situation. You are either lying to me, or everything you said is true and you are holding those two and the baby hostage. <em>Which is it?</em>&quot; He practically grolwed, his shield and weapon ready to act in case something happened. </div>

You lose all trust in kingdoms and armies.&quot; He explained, revealing a little bit of his past. &quot;We don&#39;t really know what are their intentions and honestly, would you believe that a good fighter can&#39;t find a decent job somewhere in his own country?

Anticipate attacks and be ready. Know your foes...</em> That is a small part of the words that define a watcher, I would never harm an innocent but where do you draw the line of who&#39;s innocent? How do you know that there aren&#39;t hidden elements at play here? There&#39;s magic in the world, unknown powers that can bypass anything and everything you know. I will stand by what I know.

There are worse fates, and believe me, people can be very creative with punishments...&quot; 

After finishing, the healer took another deep breath and decide to keep going, &quot;Let&#39;s keep moving, if they are as good soldiers as they claiy to be, they will protect themselves.&quot; He said and then finally took his eyes away from the other party and with a small sign for the party to get going, started to follow the path again, wanting to finally reach the general. </div>

Almost instantly, the girl winced, her golden eyes fluttering closed.

Nervous now, Sela didn’t allow her gaze to remain in any one spot for too long. Instead, she searched for any clue, any indication of the group’s current predicament. She hopes these were that General’s guards. But it was best to find out without revealing the General was the one they were looking for. At least that much information was still their own. 

“Sela,” Sela muttered after Bofwant introduced himself, though she sensed his own unease. No matter. If things went south, the pair knew how to fight and both would always have the others’ back. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="12-Apr-20 04:57 PM">(edited)</span></div>

&quot;That&#39;s certainly not a speech a Rebel would give. I do think Vult is being rather rash today, but we are under strict orders to be suspicious of any and all individuals. And trust me, the Grand General is in dire need of you. And once Vult stops being so moody...I can escort you to Grand General Krow.&quot;

&quot;There you go again...&quot; He said angrily after Vit stopped talking, the grip on his sword tightening. &quot;Trying to somehow manipulate us, like we are your soldiers. Peace you say? As much as it pains me to say it, we have no such goal. Our guild is filled with mercenaries, we don&#39;t answer to anyone but ourselves. The steel hearts has no such goal or affiliation with any kingdom. Regarded as heroes around the Eire? Sure, but that&#39;s only thanks to most guild members good hearts, nothing else. So do us all a favor and stop portraying yourself as a victim. You are paying us to escort you and we, like yhe mercenaries we are, have agreed to follow through. If you live or die? We don&#39;t really care. The guild, doesn&#39;t care.&quot;

&quot;So, you bring us here with false words, hiding the truth of the danger from us, like we are your denoxian soldiers. I don&#39;t know if you are finally telling the truth or are hiding something else, but if I find anything else, just a little thing...&quot; At that he just stopped talking and started to pace around the room, recognizing that he wasn&#39;t being helpful at all. Hopefully the others will manage to think of a decent strategy while he calms down. &quot;Answer Rok&#39;s questions.

Shifting her gaze, she then found herself staring at some portraits on the wall. The girl sighed then, her hackles raised the more everyone bickered. 

When Sela closed her eyes, she could hear the angry voices of her father, her mother. Barachiel always saw to it that he received the worst. But her twin wasn’t there. And Jericho was not her parent. The girl could hear the yelling, the shouting. She could feel his unwanted hands grabbing, touching. Her eyes flew open then, her brow glistening with sweat. 

“No!” Sela whispered harshly to the daydream haunting her mind and her soul. Looking at everyone, she felt her face grow warm, so hot from the blood rising to her cheeks. She felt embarrassed. Ashamed. Absolutely horrified that she’d done something so ridiculous. “We... we need to go back,” she then said, turning to look at Bofwant, her love shaking with anger. “The sooner, the better.

Now, if everyone is done being insufferable, shall we actually decide upon an exfiltration plan, or shall we wait for our enemies to come and end the lot of us?&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Sela’s golden eyes suddenly rested upon the raven. She’d already been certain the creature was unnatural. But watching it now, it was obvious. It made her blood curdle thinking about why such a man as Jericho had such a creature with him. Just what sorts of people did he consort with? It was a question she’d have to ask, not wishing to endanger her love, her group... the Steel Hearts. Her brother was back on the airship, still suffering from that curse some woman had placed upon him. She could still feel her eyes prying. Searching. They weren’t just on her twin any longer, but also her. 

While everyone was fussing about portraits, Sela felt her skin prickle. Those demonic eyes of the raven seeming to stare into her soul. She could hear the shouts of her father, her mother... the pain, the humiliation. The fear. Suddenly, her nightmare broke when she heard the General’s two henchmen begin to furiously pack. 

Sela glanced at the two large men, the bird, then Jericho. Her mouth felt dry, her nerves ragged and raw. “Do you consort with devils?” she then blurted, her eyes fixed on this strange man showing sentiment towards the portraits. “Your bird is from the Hells.” </div>

After finishing his creed, he had remained silent but with his eyes on Jericho. &quot;The paintings get rolled or your lackeys can carry them.&quot; He said to Jericho with a scowl. 

After hearing his companions change the subject he finally took his eyes away from the annoying general and looked at Vit, &quot;I can feel fiendish power coming out of him. A normal human with a summoned familiar wouldn&#39;t be giving off that aura of fiendishness.&quot; He explained, his words were more calm than before but anyone could tell that he was still upset with the general.

The he turned towards Sela and took a step towards her. &quot;As much as I would like to force Jericho to reveal us everything about himself... We can&#39;t. Remember what I taught you about helping others. So far the ex-general has proved himself a liar and a snobbish bastard but until he proves himself a real danger to innocents we can&#39;t really judge him as evil.&quot; He explained softly to her despite the words feeling like knives stabbing his throat. That was the hard part of being a watcher, the truth sometimes was really hard to admit and painful to say. </div>

Nor did it help how she felt right then and there. All she could do was close her eyes and try her best to stay calm. It reminded her of those dark nights back with her parents. Nights where she’d retreat to some place dark and deep within her mind. While she searched for her own internal comfort, she tuned out the conversations between the men, hoping they could all just leave and return to the airship sooner rather than later. </div>

A shiver worked its way down her spine, her nerves growing more raw by the second. Needing to settle herself, she then turned to Rok. But she’d figure out why the General was speaking about her later once she could properly concentrate. “I’ll make markings on the ground for all of you to follow.

While the men continued their talk, she found it hard to listen, deciding to keep her thoughts focused on their departure and their return to the place she now called home. Perking up slightly, she blurted softly, “Are we ready to go? I’ll go on ahead and scout to see what’s waiting, if anything.” She turned to Vit who’d be her counterpart on this little adventure, wanting to make sure he was ready and that everything she said was a go for him.

As Sela forged ahead, concealed by those comforting shadows, she felt her heart speed up. She wondered if anything would show up before they made it to that small group of soldiers. That group she wasn’t looking forward to crossing paths with again. </div>

He was a little surprised when Bit reached the group to warn them but he had been expecting trouble since this mission began. &quot;Very well.

Her golden gaze picked up on the fact that the small group of soldiers they’d passed earlier on were gone. But what was more... their tracks undoubtedly led back to the little village they’d gone through previously. She thought on the flags. The odd way of everyone. And immediately crouched low to make the tracking mark indicating everyone behind her stop. Something was wrong, off and she didn’t like it. 

As Sela finished up her mark of warning, she stood up and caught sight of Vit slowly, cautiously approaching. Out of the corner of her elf eyes, she could see the others... still unharmed and well. 

Still hidden in her shadows, she dared to peek out and let her fellow scout see where she was. If he was searching her out, it could only mean one thing... her senses were right. Something was wrong. With a nod, she replied, ”Yes, I knew something was off. I left a mark for the others to warn them.” She paused then, her one hand readying her bow, while slowly digesting Vit’s news about a probable ambush. “See there,” she then pointed out. “Those <em>loyal</em> Denoxians... they headed to that village. This... this isn’t good. We need to be prepared.” <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="23-Apr-20 09:56 PM">(edited)</span></div>

Despite having most of his focus on the road, he could hear the conversation happening behind him and it was taking a lot of him to just not turn around and beat Jericho for every word that came out of his mouth. The way he talked, the words he used, the meaning behind them. It was like everything was designed to go against everything he stood for and the only thing holding him back was his own words. He had offered help and told the general that he would do everything he could to bring him to the steel hearts. 

A mistake on his part of course, and he was not sure what would happen if these assasins weren&#39;t like the general was describing them.

&quot;No. We won&#39;t lie. The fight is inevitable at this point. If we lie we would only make everything worse by the end.&quot; He finally said, disagreeing with the plan that was being discussed. &quot;You said that you were a great general, intelligent. One of the <em>most powerful</em> men in Denoxia. Do yourself a favor and be useful, what strategy can you think of that doesn&#39;t involve more lies or deception coming out of out mouths?&quot; The healer finally asked without turning his eyes away from the road ahead, hoping to find Vit and Sela, or any sign from them. </div>

She turned towards Vit, her expression full of worry. “Then someone is still out there. How many do you think did this?

Though, hazarding a guess... I can still see the armor from here, so whoever it was wasn&#39;t out to steal valuables- good suits like that are worth a fair bit of gold. That rules out common bandits. Unlikely to be animals, the group looks mostly intact from what I can tell, none of the tell-tale missing chunks from bites... Village? Maybe, but they seemed more interested in protecting themselves than in any sort of revenge. Possible but unlikely. Which leaves... The group that Krow mentioned, most likely. A grudge against Denoxia, noted aggressive tactics, enough bodies there to overcome trained soldiers... The shoe fits, as it were.&quot; </div>

Holding back would be a lie and it was something she couldn’t do, not without feeling terrible about it. 

“We should tell them. They are all probably waiting on us as it is. I’d rather they all go into this with eyes wide open.” Sela nodded, her face showing resolve in her stance. “I know Bofwant would want the truth no matter what.” It was a bitter thing to swallow, a no win situation. But in the end, it would be the right thing to do. And she owed that much to her love. Always. 

“If you want to continue ahead,” Sela went on. “I’ll go back and tell them what we found. I leave that to you. Regardless, I will head back before we move forward once more.

After hearing Rok&#39;s words Bofwant&#39;s eyes found the mark left by Sela but no sign of them. &quot;If she left a mark then it means that there&#39;s something dangerous ahead of us...&quot; He said, mostly to himself but his voice was loud enough so everyone could hear him.

&quot;We have two options. Follow the plan and wait here or move forward because we don&#39;t know if But caught up with her before she made the sign.&quot; He explained before raising his eyes once again, showing his now scowling face. &quot;And since we still don&#39;t know if Sela was attacked...&quot; The paladin just sighed and shook his head. This was a very tricky situation but deep inside he knew that he would never compromise the safety of a fellow guild member for the life of the general.

Her blood felt as cold as ice water, as it pumped through her veins. She looked to Bofwant, wishing that he didn’t have to struggle. The girl closed her eyes and inhaled slowly, and then opened her eyes again to look to her fellow scout. It was dark news. Grim. But it had been the right thing to come back and tell them all. 

While Sela listened to the men, every part of her wanted to go after the assassins. It’s what she’d done when it was her brother she was after. It had been a long and difficult road. One fraught with hardship and isolation. But she’d had purpose. Now, she was in a strange predicament where both options seemed to appeal. But ultimately, they were being paid. But what sort of guarantee did she have that this Krow didn’t mean harm? Everything was conflicted and convoluted. She trusted no one and just wanted things to be over. 

“We just press on,” Sela said softly, hand trembling a little. “But we deal with <em>him</em> later once back on the ship and out of harm’s way. We will be more effective if we weigh all the options, think calmly without fear.” The girl paused then. “We can always revisit Denoxia should such need arise.” She looked at Krow then, a shiver running along her spine. “Perhaps we should alert Clay about what’s happening in neighboring lands.” </div>

&quot;I am sure that such a thing would be a priority for any man in power. To protect those small, innocent lives.... Specially the ones coming from your own nation...&quot; Because no matter how much Bofwant would like to finish this nightmare of a mission, some things always are more important and if there was even the smallest chance that the child could be alive, then they needed to find them. 

&quot;I will walk in the front, Mister Rok you can go directly behind me and use your skills to search for clues while I focus on intercepting any surprise attack. Mister Vit, Sela. You two have better eyes and ranged weapons, you should follow the main group, keeping an eye on our back while ready to retaliate in case we get attacked but unless necessary try to stay hidden.

Then the healer opened his eyes and turned towards Rok. &quot;I would like nothing more than to find the poor infant and give them a proper farewell, but this is the truth of war. We can&#39;t lose any more time while the guilty ones are still at large. Instead we should focus into tracking the responsible ones... The ones that need to pay for this.&quot; Bofwant told him, hopefully making him forget the babe for now and focusing on the assasins because if they did this, then they could be tracked and Rok was their best chance at doing that. </div>

Now was different and she felt a sudden lump form within her throat. For a moment, the girl thought she might retch right there in front of everybody, but she’d managed to keep everything down. Bow ready, face horror struck, it wasn’t until she took a small step back that she noticed the heavenly glow. 

Swallowing hard, Sela wasn’t sure what to make of things. She wondered if the divine beings were just as upset. Perhaps they’d lend aid? Not sure what to do, the girl just stood there a moment, golden eyes blinking and taking everything in. “Who sent them?” she then whispered to the others, hoping one might know. “Should we speak with them? Perhaps they might help, or we could help them.” </div>

An execution with no chance to survive... At least for most.&quot; His voice was loud enough so the group could heard him but still softer than normal.

Then Sela&#39;s whisper reached his ears but he decided to not turn around to avoid upsetting the glaring angel. &quot;Unless any of us knows celestial... We should avoid any interaction with them... And just let them finish their task.&quot; He released a tired breath and adjusted his shield, ready in case anything happened. </div>

It never set right with her and was something she recalled her parents arguing over rather frequently. “Though I’m sure you’re right,” she went on, turning towards Bofwant and then the others. “If it’s best to leave them to their task, then so be it.” She looked to her fellow scout then. “Yes, I hope they find peace. And I hope we soon can return home.” She pursed her lips into a fine line, eyes searching for signs of the killers and then resting on the hovering angel. She hoped that ethereal being found them. No one deserved this horrifying end. Just then, she recalled the night her parents had died, granting her freedom. Peace. She could still see the puddles of blood, the piles of gore. It was the only time she’d been happy to see someone die. And it was a disturbing feeling that haunted her forever, made her feel ashamed for even existing at all. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Sela has vaguely recalled the angelic being from her readings she’d done with her brother. Though their parents had kept them both sequestered away, they’d been made to learn about the world in which they’d been born. The girl recalled those days, as her mother stared at her with poisonous eyes, her father’s hands itching to touch and feel... Barachiel had been her life line and other half. The one to help her not forget who she was and that life was sometimes worth living. 

Just then, Sela blinked several times, the angel fading from their realm into another. She turned then, seeing the men about her a bit unsettled. Her love wished to move on, while others wanted to make pause if only for a moment. And then there was Jericho. A shiver ran along her spine and she took a few steps closer to Bofwant. 

Just then, Sela heard the men’s voice get agitated, almost heated. And in that moment she was back in her childhood home, her mother’s words laced with venomous hate, her father’s eyes watching and making her uncomfortable. Her breaths quickened, a feeling of suffocation slowly enveloping her. “I... I need to keep going,” she whispered, but it was also an admission. The longer she faced the silence, the unease... the lack of purpose... the harder it all became. And the last thing she wanted to be was a burden to the others while in this foreign land. She wanted to be helpful. Useful. So completing things successfully was the definite goal, though her very soul questioned how Captain Clay could allow such darkness aboard his vessel. </div>

The unease she felt crept along her skin like some sort of film, sticking fast to her flesh, making her feel vulnerable and exposed. Trying to quiet her mind, she quickened her pace, staying close to Bofwant as they all moved. “Perhaps myself and Vit ought to take cover,” she then suggested. “Just in case the coast isn’t totally clear.” It had been their formation and decision earlier on, so she figured it might be good to resume, just to stay safer.

She shivered when her eyes fell upon the General, and she quickly moved them to her love. Her features showed her worry, but she moved to cover and began to listen and watch. She heard Rok’s whispers about an archer, so her golden eyes followed his words, instructions giving away his location.

The healer quickly raised his eyes and saw the enemies that appeared. He unsheathed his sword and held in in front of him. On its shiny surface he caught the reflection of Jericho and decided that no matter how much he despised the general, these assasins were willing to kill them on the spot and he would keep his word. &quot;<em>You shall not be afraid of the terror by night, Nor of the arrow that flies by day, Nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, Nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday.</em>&quot; He muttered and his sword pulsed with power. Quickly Jericho was surrounded with holy power, <em>probably would feel uncomfortable for him</em> thought bofwant but he didn&#39;t care since it would help to protect him.

Then he got into a fighting stance and hot ready for the incoming fight. He knew that both Sela and Vit would probably take care of the long range fighters and he an Rock would take on the brawlers but no matter what, he would be ready to keep everyone alive. </div>

The girl closed her eyes then, knowing full well the source of her fear. Just then, her eyes opened and she accidentally let go of the taut string.

Sela gasped, her lips quirking up into a crooked half smile. She’d done it. A first since her pursuits when out searching for her twin. Licking her lips, she made note of where the others were and then used the brush of the woods to conceal her, as she headed towards a rock closer to the oncoming men, clearly ready to the General they were escorting. </div>

The only thing the poor elf hears is her beating heart pounding against her skull. Gasping, almost choking on air, the girl tried to desperately take a breath. A strange blackness shrouded her vision and she felt the bile begin to rise. Just then, she doubled over. Heaving. Feeling as though she might be sick....

And then it was over. 

Suddenly, Sela was back in the moment, her golden eyes sliding away from that hideous sight that brought all the memories back. She heard the call of the shadows, succumbing to their warmth easily. She then turned and saw the lone elf, her bow at the ready, an arrow let loose to fly. In an instant, the girl watched her arrow find its mark. Another rebel crumpling to the ground before them all. </div>

This was what he didn&#39;t particularly liked from being a &#39;blessed knight&#39;, he knew from experience that power was not good or bad, it only depends how it&#39;s used but the one that Jericho used just clashed against his holy nature. Shaking off the unpleasant sensation he remembered his training and quickly scanned the battlefield and caught the tail of Sela&#39;s attack. 

Now only one enemy remained and he also remember what Rok had said about his abilities in combat so he decided to move forward (his guard still up in case any hidden enemy appeared) and let Jericho&#39;s own guards the task of defending him while he got closer to offer medical assistance to his guildmembers...

                    <div class="markdown">Sela felt a dull pain throb somewhere inside her head. It... ached. Made it difficult to focus. She refused to acknowledge it, as she walked back to the group, though the pain persisted and just grew stronger with each and every step. Finally, she touched her hand to her forehead and groaned softly, her eyes noting that unnatural arm of the General. The girl tried to gauge everyone else, but none of them seemed to be affected like she was. 

“Everyone all right?” Sela asked softly, her golden eyes fixed fast on the ground, as her insides knotted and her tummy churned. She caught the end of Jericho’s monologue, her vision darkening once more. 

While Sela tried pushing past the pain, the sound of her beating heart, her rushing blood, the only things she could hear, she clutched the healers kit close to her chest. For a moment, she tried focusing on breathing. In and out, in and out. “I... I c-can help someone, if they n-need it,” she managed, but just barely. The girl collapsed to her knees then, turning away, as her mind flooded with dark memories of the past. She could still hear her parents whispering in infernal against her ears, lost and unaware of what was happening in the moment right there with the rebels. </div>

Just then, she turned slightly and looked up into his face, her own looking sickly, as she swallowed down that wretched feeling she might be sick again. 

“Bofwant...” Sela whimpered, immediately hugging him and burying her face against his shoulder. The girl shook a bit, peering behind her love only to glimpse that arm again. She could remember it like it was yesterday, those sick chants she caught her parents doing. She’d been their lure, their means to bait otherworldly things to a circle they so wrongfully thought that they controlled. She remembered the horror in her father’s eyes when one creature touched her, its kiss sealing something then she didn’t understand and probably never would. In her young mind it had been repayment. Repayment for not being able to save her brother from that oni....

“Can we... can we leave yet?” Sela asked hopefully, her eyes back on Bofwant. She needed his face, his touch. Anything to rid herself of this vileness she felt working its way over her body. “Is it... is it over?” </div>

He knew from experience that she needed something to ground her in the present, something to let her mind focus and not fall prey to her own fears.

Just like he used to do with the small and scared children he always ended up taking care in the middle of battlefields, he started to softly repeat those words of wisdom the elder Watchers had taught him and he had learned that now, applied to him too. &quot;<em>When the wicked came against me...

It was something she’d have to work on and the path to fix herself would hardly be easy. She was so... broken. Ashamed. Slowly becoming a burden to all. 

The air seemed calmer, as Sela walked with Bofwant, her golden eyes scanning their area for her lost arrows. She’d used four, which hadn’t been overly many. Still, if she could find at least a couple, she’d be happy. And with her love’s help, she was certain that she would. “Thanks,” she then mumbled, feeling a smile work its way upon her lips. The man had a way of making her smile, feel good about herself. Looking up at him, she could also tell that he meant it. And that only made her feel warm. Special. Loved. 

“I’ll do better next time,” Sela added, leaning some of her weight against Bofwant, while they walked. “Oh, there’s one arrow,” she pointed out. It had been stuck in the trunk of the tree. Carefully, she freed the thing and placed it back in her quiver. 

“I just don’t ever want to be the cause of someone else’s injury because I lost focus or had a flashback.” Sela frowned then, wanting Bofwant to be proud of her, and also hoping she could somehow improve. “I could have cost us our mission.” </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Sela found a couple of her arrows, and that was enough to satisfy the girl. Still quite shaken, she remained close to Bofwant, the two slowly making their way back to the group. The red head would not look up, eyes fixed on the ground below. She was afraid that the strange arm might somehow make a return, bring back those memories she’d almost forgotten she’d possessed. It was easier not to think on those dark times, to let them just invade her sleep. While awake, she was in control... or was she?

Sela began questioning that too. And it was something that unsettled her deeply, right to her core. 

As Sela approached the group with her love by her side, her golden gaze found the elf that had been whimpering before she’d gone off to search for her lost arrows. It sounded like she’d be joining them from the bit she’d heard of them all talking. Rather than saying anything to everyone, she just looked up at Bofwant with a hopeful expression. “So, can we go home now? Are we going?” As she waited for answer, she hoped with all her heart that the answer was ‘yes’. </div>

&quot;This place... I think I will rather enjoy it here. It has a certain aura to it. Regardless, I must commend you all for outstanding service.
