There were more speaking tubes here then anywhere else on the ship.  It was the control center of the entire ships...

But there were other things here.  Clothing was strewn about, mostly undergarments.  Empty bottles, some remains of treats and dirty dishes.  It looked like someone lived here.  Finally there was all manner of musical instrument tucked into one of the corners.  A guitar leaning on a new cushioned chair seemed to the most touched thing in the room.

&quot;Forgive the mess.&quot;  She said before she goes to the main control, her hands going over some of the levers and she checks a few of the dials.  She taps ones a bit, before banging on it.  &quot;So whats your story, Lucy?&quot;  She asks while her chair swivels. </div>

&quot;Ha, yeah I hope I don&#39;t ever live forever that would be hell. I don&#39;t know where to start really. I guess ill start from beginning as it did start from young age. I grew up blessed to have my parents in my life. It is far and few between for a genasi to have both parents to be raised. We were a noble family that was well respected. The symbol of the flame in our town and many surrounding it. As a kid I grew up pampered I will not lie. Never a thought really crossed my mind of need or desire. The toll for that was strict regulations. No going outside unaccompanied. No retaliation to towns peoples disgust at my appearance. There was a lot. They found it unnatural for a humanoid flame to be walking around yet there were so many other exotic people around every corner sadly genasi are rare all around. I attended every meeting and every discussion as my mind wandered. I had over heard about forbidden to me magic and science. Things I didn&#39;t need for plain life doing my duty as a noble yet as I got older crossing by shops that had enchanted objects or teaching how to cast. I wanted that but couldn&#39;t have it. I use to sneak out at night throwing water on myself to extinguish my flame as to not be seen. It felt like death but it worked every time. I went to those teachings and made beautiful art. People saw me as a human instead of the noble being paraded around town collecting money for the land. I..&quot; </div>

&quot;Okay, makes sense.&quot;
&quot;Yeah I would too.&quot;
&quot;Ouch, water really that bad for you?  Pff, you should try sunlight sometime, thats a bitch.&quot;

He didn&#39;t give her the whole story.   She flared her nose, looking confused.  &quot;That&#39;s it.  You have to work on your endings Lulu.&quot;  A pet name maybe.  She looked at her guitar, she played with the frets and stiffened her lip.  &quot;Hmm?  Here, let me show you how its done.&quot;

&quot;You probably don&#39;t know anything about the Clays do you?  Would you be surprised if we were a bunch of Necromancers?  Yeah, big friggin shocker right?  Never members of the noble family but we were rich enough to have a nice place of our own.   Our claim to fame was shipping.  We kept the roads, the ships, and eventually the skies open for trade into the country.  No one suspected for a long time that our labor force were a bunch of skeletons in body suits.  We were in real good with noble houses.  And then the Pendragons showed up.  We kept up our industry, but the real money was in power.  Dead power.   And that&#39;s where I come in.&quot;

“So you delivered mail and packages? Hm. I can say i probably have used your system when mailing my official letters or transport of good. How did you go from shipping to adventurer babysitting?”

“It all started with great gramps, Cassius.&#160; I think he was an adventurer or at least he was at some point.&#160; Typical bookworm type, and way smarter than most people figured.&#160; He was part of an ancestor cult, and apparently a legit one. They dealt with proper burial rites and customs, aiding ghosts into the various after lifes.&#160; Then there was some kind of schism. Some holy war to make sure gods got worshipped rather then ghosts. He was among the funerists who was raising the dead to protect the living.&#160; &#160; Guess he learned first hand that even ‘the dark arts’ can be put into productive means. I think that was when he became an adventurer himself.”

“From the stories he told me as a girl, that was where he really lived.&#160; Meeting my great grandma, others who would help build his caravans and make his connections.&#160; Made the company when he retired, and I guess he just didn’t want to give it up.” She was looking at the ceiling. </div>

He had never took the time to think about how his letters or gifts were taken across the world. He guessed some wizard had just poofed it to the right place in the world or something. Then to add raising the dead he was more confused by the end of it then at the beginning. 

&quot;All that going all over the place it must have been hard to make friends. I can&#39;t imagine dealing with the dead. I know the goddess or god  stuff is real but I thought they dealt with all the passing problems. Sheltered life prevented me from going out to places were those kind of rituals or magic were happening I guess. Cults also were a thing of fairy tails in my mind. Are they bad as people make them out to be? You&#39;re past makes them seem not that bad when look at it from an outsiders point of view.&quot;

<em>He went silent after that twirling the small wax press. He didn&#39;t... no couldn&#39;t grasp the idea that he had no knowledge of any of these things that seem like basic knowledge. His hair flared up a slight aqua color as he reminisced about all the things he probably missed out of or didn&#39;t know. Shaking his head he tried to clear his mind and listen to her fully. It was rude to not listen to a little lady when they spoke.</em>

&quot;This may mean nothing coming from me but it sounds amazing. You have probably seen things or know about places I can&#39;t even imagine. I mean your past has character to it. It wasn&#39;t slaying gods turning evil, dragons, or beholders but it has spirit to it. I couldn&#39;t name one thing about my parents past if it was dependent on my life. You have had a life suiting of the best of hearted. Cassius sounds like the man I only wish to have been or could have been. They raised something so amazing from dirt and ashes. He knew the system and got above it. Making a legacy for himself despite not many knowing of it.&quot; <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="22-Dec-19 12:49 PM">(edited)</span></div>

But-“&#160; She had to be realistic. “They can be the exact opposite or way way worse then you know.”&#160; She began, taking a drink from a glass nearby. There was something... strangely serene, saccharin about her now.&#160; She liked to talk or to teach. Lucy had made her run her mouth, and she strangely seemed to enjoy it more then she let on.&#160; Maybe she was just lonely. “I mean, the Order of the Final Dusk is technical a cult, but they only tend to family altars and make sure ancestors are remembered.&#160; I hung out with them. Depressing, but they loved their music.”
His praise was met with a little smirk by her.&#160; She needed to think a minute on how to respond to him as he raved like essentially a little kid.&#160; It was, kind of refreshing to her. “Heh, I didn’t even get to myself yet. This all happened before I was born.&#160; Hundreds of years ago.” 

She listened to him, putting the guitar away as she leaned forward, her legs wide, as if she neither noticed, nor cared that her frilly panties could be seen underneath her open skirt.&#160; “Well, I guess that might be the point of all this. When you’re immortal, your greatest enemy is boredom, that and losing your humanity. Gramps seems to be ignoring that. He’s dead, a metal skeleton, but he’s always been surrounded by family.&#160; Its why some of us agreed to go with him. Take the step to live forever, in our own weird ways. Maybe he wants to spread the love. He calls the guild family. Maybe one of you guys can use this to make something more of yourself. Its not a bad thought really.”&#160; She shrugs. </div>

“I can understand the misunderstand with the reputation of a organization being a“cult”. From what you tell me it seems more like well as cheesy as it is family. It doesn’t seem to have that darker under tone of harm for harms sake of the legend of bad cults. I do not know if its because of how you described it or it is as it is but it seems fun.”

<em>Seeing the smirk he rolled his eyes playfully chuckling tucking his crossed legs closer to his body.</em>

“The Final Dusk sound a bit creepy will not let a lie run but im sure they have good intent to their madness. Even if it wasnt you it was your “family” line. A mans... or women’s line can tell a lot about a person or so I have been told. I believe it does. I believe you made a good choice. I mean look at where you are now. Your “gramps” offer has lead you to a path where you can branch off into endless excitement and boredom no where in the near future.”

His thought died on his tongue as he glanced back up face glowing red and snapped his head to the side so quick to the side his bones popped. Coughing to try seem like he was just covering up that instead of staring at the women’s undergarments.

“ I mean I am here just for the fun. We do not live long as some species. Best make the best of it and move along better then we were. I-“

<em>He couldn’t pretend to carry on the conversation glancing back he got another view flaring up his flames before looking up.</em>

“ I did not wish to tell you earlier rather not making the room tense but you are flashing a bit more then you would probably prefer.” </div>

He complimented in his flowery way and she was beside herself.  He was good company.  A little foppish but ehh,.   &quot;Its been reasonably more interesting lately.  I just hope I dont become a skeleton.&quot;  

She did notice he was getting a little blushie and for a moment, she didnt know what he was talking about.  She then realized.  &quot;Oh yeah.

“You seem a little sensitive about it.”&#160; She concluded from his demeanor and his monologues.&#160; “Either that means you dontmaybe there was a special someone.”&#160; She then decided it might be best to be a little clear. “If you’re not after a cheap roll in the hay, I’d say that makes you all the better.”&#160; She looks over at the speaking tubes. “No one turns the tubes off, so I get to listen to the bump and grind day and not. It gets to the point that it almost becomes meaningless.”

She bristled a little, her face stiffening a little bit.&#160; She had to think about whether she had insulted him at some point.&#160; But she waved a hand and shrugged a little bit not know why he got on the defensive.&#160; “Catty? Yeah you’re probably right.” She chuckled despite herself. “What’s wrong with a proper professional becoming a personal relationship?&#160; I’ve lived long enough to be fucked up down left and sideways. All the ass the world don’t mean shit without the heart ya know.” He pats her chest a little.&#160; “Get to be my age, and thats the shit you remember the most. The ones you leave behind. The ones you never wanted to. You learn to live in the moment, otherwise you end up going pretty crazy.”

“Yeah I’m a romantic.&#160; Shutup.” She said preemptively.&#160; “It helps me write music.” </div>

&quot;I did not mean to come off sensitive. It is not something talked about.. ever in home area.&quot;

<em>Humming softly he settled down his antics and leaned to one side of his body hip popped out.</em>

&quot;I am all for a &#39;roll in the hay&#39; but I wouldn&#39;t consider paying cheap for it. I had someone in my sights when I was younger. Stood me up. Long story not enough time in the world.&quot;

<em>He huffed as if it was work just to think about it. Turning to glance back at the tubes he cocked an eye brow up. He would have to remember to close any near his door. He did not want her hearing him getting it on.</em>

&quot;It must not be fun hearing all that why don&#39;t you just stuff the tube with cloth till they are done?  As for my previous statement I may have been the one being catty. I apologize. I am not use to the relaxed nature of this... yet. I am trained to be wound up and ready.&quot;

<em>He tutted trying to think of a good way to put what he wished to say before shrugging.</em>

&quot;When you allow yourself to become close to someone you have. The harder time you have when they unavoidably leave you.&quot; <em>His eyes and flames darkened and his face morphed from polished thinking to a hair-raising hallow look.</em> &quot;You of all people should know nothing worth its self is forever. The heart is the thing that keeps us alive but it is also the thing that stops keeping us alive even as we still walk the earth. You could live less then a year and already be dead inside or a million years and still be alive depending on how much you protect yourself.&quot;

<em>He blinked and his normal looking cheeky smile returned. He was trying to warn her of what people become when they allow them self to love to much. He really did enjoy their manner of thinking but saw what he thought as the unavoidable flaw in it.</em>

&quot;Much better to have fun and leave it as that, but who needs a pretentious little genasi to tell them what to do?&quot; <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="08-Jan-20 01:42 PM">(edited)</span></div>

I imagine half of them aren’t even doing it right.” She snorts a little, getting a mental image.&#160; It was a cute snort. She mentioned patching. “Never know when somethings going to happen. We had to break up a lovers quarrel the other day. Figures its the time that most people wouldn’t want to be interrupted.&#160; Fight breaks out, call in the idiot Dawn to break it up.”

He apologized and she appreciated it with a wave of his hand.&#160; He went off on a moment of self reflection. Whoever the girl was really must have hurt him to make him so, embittered by the thought of.&#160; It was enough that she leaned against the back of her chair and put her foot up on the edge of it. She could tell him he was preaching to the choir but in a moment of profound maturity she let him vent, get it off his chest if silently.&#160; Her eyes drifted to the window.
“Yeah.&#160; I remember when I felt like that.”&#160; She said in agreement. She nestled her head against her knee, getting a nice dreamy sparkle in her eye and a smile on her face.&#160; She held up a finger, it starts slowly going round and round in a corner. “Its why immortality sucks. The pain doesnt go away, it never does.&#160; Not unless you kill part of yourself. But eventually it comes back. If the hole doesnt get bigger, you’re trying to close it back up. Filling it with anything.&#160; Im sorry Lucy. She must have been really something.” She comments.&#160;&#160;
She laid her head against the knee, her piercing eyes looking up at him.&#160; “Is that what you want? To have fun with me? Be done with it?” </div>

&quot;If you can&#39;t block the tubes you could just yell at them to close it. If that doesn&#39;t work I can&#39;t imagine what to do about those scamps.&quot;

<em>He looked to the window trying to keep his emotions settled and from flaring up. He knew he was being over baring with his words but better to be seen as stuck up and over baring then knowing he didn&#39;t try to warn them. Looking over to the immortal he recognized the look in her eyes. His own eyes fluttered dimming a bit as he thought about the one love he had. His throat seemed to almost burn with licks of flames despite knowing it wasn&#39;t truly flames. Hearing her apologize he blinked back into reality jerked from the dream of dances and love land.</em>

&quot;What? Do not apologize for things beyond your control. Fire and lava do not mix surprisingly she is nothing to me now. I am fine and simply as you put it &#39;trying to close it back up.&#39;&quot;

<em>Turning he caught their eyes as she looked at him his body tensing at their question body turned halfway away from them shoulder .</em>

&quot;It was not my first thought when seeing you but you oddly do have an allure. How you word it makes it seem like I am looking for a fuck toy to toss afterwards. Do not get an idea that I am looking for commitment. Simply I do like our talks.&quot; </div>

Lucy would be the first to know that their lives were in the hands of a vindictive vampire bard.
She huffs.&#160; “Ill show sympathy if I damn well please.”&#160; She says with an aloof attitude, making it very apparent that she didn’t care much if he accepted it or not.&#160; “I relate so I sympathize.” It was human after all. It was like she needed to stay in practice less the tedium of immortality make her cold and stale like her grandfather.
“Oddly?”&#160; She questioned.&#160; “I still think I look pretty damn good.”&#160; She put her arms around her head as she leaned back in her chair.&#160; “That’s pretty much what I was getting at. But of course it would be the other way round.”&#160; Like she’d ever be the toy in any relationship. Faun over a partner. “Agreed. If I threw you out, I’d lose probably the only person lately that bothered conversation for so long.&#160; Good. Look but don’t touch then.” And that seemed the end of it. She was thirsty for something more then Lucy was willing to give. Friends she could use.

Garg took a step forward, letting Hal to read the note as he just started to look bat every little detail. Ok, he will admit that the was fucking impressed and only could figure out the controls thanks to his... Errr, wide knowledge on ships. Not because he was a ship nerd that spent days and weeks researching as much as he could each time he visited a city with his parents while he was a pup... And even while he was doing his internship with the kraken.

&quot;This shadow girl...&quot; He started while grabbing the main wheel, not caring about this Viola fucker. &quot;Who&#39;s would be the direction wheel... Only this one you can pull back or push forward to tip the nose of this giant fucker...&quot; Even his growly voice wasn&#39;t as angry as usual, even carrying a few tones of wonder in it. 

&quot;This other...&quot; He grabbed the one at his left and turned it around a little, &quot;Controls the altitude.&quot; And just like he said, the ship gained a little altitude, the change was shown in the instrument neat that wheel. &quot;Those two little fuckers control how much wind the sails are catching on each side of the ship, this one for the port side and this for the starboard side.&quot; He explained but didn&#39;t touch those, instead he stepped aside and extended a hand towards Hal so she would join him at the wheel. &quot;Come here shadow girl... And bring the sextant.&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Hal’s eyes widened momentarily when Garg pushed aside the note from Viola and, instead, started gushing over everything he saw. At first, she worried the Clays might be angered, that they were intruding or possibly something worse!

“Viola won’t mind? I... I’ve not met her,” Hal admitted, though she peered over Garg’s shoulder to get a better view of just what it was he was doing. The shark was like a schoolboy. Excited and eager and all too ready to delve into the gadgetry displayed before them. Though Hal worried a little about the Clay who’d left that note, she decided to focus the majority of her attention on Garg and what he was showing her. 

There was a lot to learn. And even more to prepare for. But Hal wanted this and would do her best. She took Garg’s offered hand and joined him, holding out the bag he’d given her and then took out the sextant. She eyed the contraption, paying particular attention to the piece that looked like a scope of some kind. “So how do I use this exactly?” she asked, her thoughts hoping this Viola wouldn’t return for a while. </div>

At least in the beginning.&quot; He growled before stepping behind her and guiding her hands to she could see how to properly use the device.

After Hal was grabbing the sextant in the correct way he guided it to her eyes. &quot;Can you see the two different images? You need to view the horizon with the left one, use it as your guide. And now you move this until the celestial body you are using as reference is properly aligned...&quot; He explained as he showed her how to use the thing.

It was barely nightfall, the sky was still a light purple and the starts were starting to show up. He growled in frustration because it was not the proper time to use it but then he had an idea. Thumping his tail against the ground he used his magic to change the view in front of them, showing a perfect night filled with stats and the moon at its highest, perfect for Hal to use it as reference. &quot;Find the moon and align it with the fucking horizon and the sextant will show you our latitude.&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Hal gasped, as she peered through the scope of the sextant. It was odd see two different images, and odder still when she moved the bar and caused half of the image to move. Eventually, the moon was kissing the horizon line in the distance. When it did, she immediately stopped and pulled back, her eyes wide with wonder. “That was so strange!” she exclaimed, glancing down to see where the bar ended up. “Did I do it right, Captain?” she asked, though her sweet smile showed that hope she felt bubbling up inside. 

With excitement plastered all over her face, Hal showed Garg how she’d moved the bar. How the bar had indicated a number. A reading. She bit down on her lip, waiting to see what he’d say, an eagerness to know if she’d done well or poorly. Regardless, she was aware she needed to study more to get the hang of it. But she so hoped to have at least managed a little. She needed to if she was to be of proper use when they went back for Keth. His life depended on it. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Garg chuckled at Hal&#39;s eagerness to learn and see if she was doing things in the right way. It was refreshing to have someone useful around. &quot;Aye, you did shadow girl m... Look&quot; He growled in her hear while turning nher body around so she could see some instruments on the right side of the cockpit.

He tapped one of them what was showing a number, &quot;This ship has a Magical Positioning System... Fuck, I thought those were only myths and theories but these fuckers have one. With this one you don&#39;t need those other instruments since this uses magical points around the world as reference to always know the current ship coordinates.&quot; He explained, still amazed by the ship... Everything.

And just like he told her, what Hal had calculated with the sextant was almost the same coordinate that the MPS was showing on the little display. &quot;The thing you need to remember in that to use the sextant, you need to use a celestial body at its fucking highest and even then only experience can help you to correct any fucking deviations... But you did good for your first time.&quot; He told her with a grin before he pushed his face close to hers and grabbed her hips pulling her a little closet to him. &quot;Looks like you always do well in your first times shadow girl...&quot;

Then he moved a few inches closer and bumped his nose against hers before moving back with a laugh and dismissing the illusion in front of them, the view returning to the one just after sunset. &quot;Well, anything else you would like to know how to use?&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">”I’m uncertain, Captain, since I’m not entirely sure what all of these various devices do.” A heat rose to Hal’s cheeks, the pale flesh of her neck darkening to a pretty rosy color. “Though I’m glad to be doing well enough so far. I’ll continue the studies,” she went on, that heat traveling along her body and settling somewhere between her legs. Garg’s strong presence and manner somehow always making her thighs start to quiver. “Though if there’s anything more I should know before next lesson, please do tell me.”

Hal looked up into Garg’s eyes and gave him a pretty smile. Most might be frightened of him, still others bothered by his manner. But he pulled her in, like the predator he was, and she didn’t mind this at all. Not one little bit. The shark made her feel more alive than she’d ever had, as one of those spies for the Phiarlan House. The Baron has depleted her soul, drained her, took everything away that she possibly could. But this sharkin. He was able to replenish it all, and most of all make her feel loved. Love? Was that what this was in its own strange sort of way? As the girl gazed upon her Captain, the only conclusion she could come to was... yes. Yes, she did love him. And she always would. 

In that moment of realization, Hal felt her tummy flutter, her heart begin to speed up. Face feeling hot, she felt hope and happiness deep deep into her blood. The girl peered into Garg’s strange eyes then, needing to see those same things and wanting him to see just how deep all of this between them truly went. “I... I want you happy, Captain.” </div>

I have no idea how these fuckers got these but it&#39;s fucking mind blowing.&quot; Even if a sentient cursed galleon was still way better for the sharkin, he could give some credit where it was due. Whoever this Viola fucker was, she sure has a fun time handling the ship, he thought with a laugh.

Then he turned around to look at Hal once again and a grin appeared on his shark face at her words. &quot;What a good first mate I have found...&quot; He growled lowly whole moving closer and wrapping a big arm around her waist to pull her against his cool body. &quot;... Always wanting to please her captain...&quot; He growled teasingly and licked the fresh marks around her neck. He had a lot of fun being with Hal and while he wasn&#39;t sure if she just liked all the fucking they did, it was hard to find such a perfect crew member so he was not to let her escape him like all the others had done in the past. </div>

Without realizing it, she groaned softly, hands clutching onto him, his own pulling her close to his body. The girl looked up at him then, cheeks rosy and bright, eyes shining. “Y-yes, Captain,” she whispered, already breathless, their hips somehow fitting together where they stood. “I... I hope you don’t mind.” She smiled then, making shy noises, as the blush worked its way along the rest of her body. 

Hal honestly couldn’t even remember life before the sharkin had entered it. Though, she wondered what he’d have thought of her had he seen how she’d been back in the Feywild. Back when she’d been under the Baron’s thumb. Or worse, back when she’d allowed herself to be manipulated by the elven nobility and the fairy courts of old. Looking back, it was embarrassment... to her brother, her friend, to her parents. And how she missed them both!

“I plan to be the best, Captain,” Hal went on. “Need to set precedent for your crew.” She bit down on her lip. “Plus...” She paused a moment, swallowing hard. “You... you deserve no less than that, Captain. So I’ll help make that happen.” </div>

He was still grinning as he bumped his nose against her again. &quot;A pirate deserves nothing but has everything to take.&quot; He growled in answer to her words. &quot;Just like I took my ship... And now you.&quot; That was his way of life. He took what he wanted, when he wanted as long as he was able to do it and don&#39;t die like a idiot in the process. 

&quot;With you as the first mate and me as the captain... Our crew will be the most feared one, not only in the sea but in all the planes.&quot; His growly voice was very serious as he told her that. It was his goal after all, to become a legend. The most feared pirate. The fucking Boogeyman of the Sea.

&quot;For now, we know what&#39;s the first step. Get some fucking firepower.&quot; He loosened his hold on Hal but didn&#39;t move away, his hands just resting on her hips, happy to let her cling to him and enjoy her warmth. He raised his head though, looking over her into the dark sky on the other side of the glass, &quot;Once we have that, the shadow squid will be a proper raiding ship.&quot; He growled, mostly to himself and then shook his head, looking down at Hal again. &quot;So what you wanna do now shadow girl? Not everything is work in a pirate&#39;s life.&quot; </div>

She lowered her gaze, nodding all the while, only to look back up into Garg’s eyes once more. “Well...” she started, stammering just a bit. The girl recalled what had happened back on that job. How that swim had nearly destroyed her. Never again did she want to fear the water, especially now that Garg was her... she wasn’t quite sure how to define it. She knew what she felt and she was now fairly certain the sharkin felt the same. Was there a word for such things? She wasn’t sure. It hadn’t been something she’d considered before leaving behind her home and everything that had been familiar. 

“Well, would you mind helping me learn how to better cope in the water. I think there’s a pool on board, though I... I’ve never been. And I admittedly have avoided after, well, what happened on <em>that</em> job.” Again, Hal looked away, almost ashamed to look into Garg’s red eyes. “I don’t want to be a weak link on a job,” she explained, shaking her red head. “I... I had been among the best when I was a spy for my House.” </div>
