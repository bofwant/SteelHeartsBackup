He walked closer to the railings and crossed his arms over his chest, enjoying the smell of the sea that invaded his nose. He missed this, the feeling of freedom and the excitement before a raid. Now that he wasn&#39;t a slave to his own biology he could enjoy these little pleasures more than before. He could feel the cold magic the kraken had given him flowing through his sharkin body, even his powers knew that he was close to his home. The sea.

Far away, under the clouds, the silver assholes fortress could be seen. He was sure that it was filled with &#39;confiscated&#39; riches but he was only after the only thing that was really worth it. The special longboat called the shadow squid, it&#39;s real name and abilities only known by the kraken employees.

An evil smile appeared on his face when he imagined all the fun he will have once that ship was under his command, the shadows covering his body in the shape of a coat and a captain&#39;s hat started to move showing his excitement. &quot;Those idiots have no idea what awaits them...&quot; He growled, his words getting lost in the salty wind. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Whether Garg’s tail striking her legs was intentional or an accident, Hal wasn’t sure. But it was cool to the touch and definitely not enough to hurt. The girl’s blue gaze slid down to briefly scan her leg before moving back to the crowd of banterers. While she watched them, she wondered just what had happened in the shark’s life to make him so coarse and prickly. And was it something that could be remedied? She had to admit, she hoped it could... whatever it was. But then, everyone had their reasons for being. And everyone deserved a chance to be understood and allowed a chance to make things right, if needed. 

“I went to the library,” Hal admitted. She hadn’t explained anything to anyone, but she had told them all where she’d be going. It wasn’t her fault no one followed. “I wanted to know more about these Silver Knights.” Her cheeks flushed a pale shade of pink, as the blood rose to her face. “Figured it would be helpful.” The girl then turned towards Ford and Cheer. “These knights...” she began. “They are versed in the undead, this kingdom’s last resort to vanquish the unholy.” Her face blanched a bit. “I’m not from this plane,” she went on. “So I’m unfamiliar with the politics, but... I understand enough that this will be dangerous and any magic we can utilize will be to our advantage.”

Hal swallowed hard and then turned back to Garg. “And I’m not the best swimmer, but.... I can hold my own if needed.” Water didn’t frighten her and she’d try her best. It was all she could offer and she hoped that it would be enough. </div>

The ship had been hovering over some low clouds at his request but they were still over 1000 feet high. Luckily for his idiots he had experience with diving into the sea from such altitudes. The trick was one he had perfected thanks to his boss throwing him around. He had contacted the kraken to take care of that, so his crew would survive and successfully infiltrate the assholes stronghold.

As he fell through the clouds and the sea became visible under him, he mentally called his boss and a big tentacle (way bigger than the ones he could summon with his own power) rose from the deep waters, forming a big slide that would help them survive the fall. &quot;I fucking missed this!!&quot; He roared just before he landed and went underwater. </div>

Thrin doesn&#39;t finish the thought as they rest their weight on the tentacle, and immediately regret not just sliding like everyone else, because that&#39;s exactly what ends up happening as they fall, losing grip on the railing. They disappear unceremoniously with a surprised shriek.

                    <div class="markdown">After all of them reached the sea, the giant tentacle  dissapeared into the depths, leaving no trace of it&#39;s prescence.

The party found themselves in the middle of the ocean, a few miles from the fortress they were supposed to raid. Only the faint outline of the structure and the island could be seen on the horizon.

Garg appeared in the classic way of the sharks, by swimming a few laps around the group, only his dorsal fin could be seen above the water. He wasn&#39;t even trying to fuck with them, he was just enjoying the feeling of the sea after so long, and for the first time in his life he didn&#39;t feel the need to hunt some food when he recognized the faint signals that the sea life produced as they swam around.

&quot;Fuck, I needed that...&quot; He growled after finally stopped swimming around and raising his head above the water so the group could heard him. &quot;Now listen up. I said that there was no plan... I meant that, but I&#39;m no idiot. We aren&#39;t gonna storm the place and practically hand ourselves to those assholes, there&#39;s another entrance, one that only creatures that can breathe underwater can use. Luckily for you almost no one can beat the speed of a sharkin, if you hold your breath long enough we can reach the air before any of you drown.&quot; He explained and raised his nose to take a deep breath, enjoying the smell of salt.

&quot;Still...&quot; He continued, &quot;I&#39;m not your fucking carriage, so we will swimm until we are near the entrance,&quot; at that he raised an arm and pointed towards where they were supposed to swim, &quot;And then I&#39;ll drag you with me... Now, start fucking swimming!!&quot; He cheered in a way that was clearly mocking them and started to swim around once again. Honestly he could take them there from here and then letting them catch their breath before diving but he wanted to enjoy his time in the water. </div>

The feel of the wind blowing through her fiery red hair, the spray of the sea kissing her face. She almost forgot she was falling down into a large watery mass. When her body finally hit the water below, she sucked in a sharp breath of shock. Immediately, she began to swim, trying her best to shake off the peculiar feeling of being in an environment unnatural to her own. It was hard going and more so wearing her clothing and carrying her equipment. Even still she did her best. But unfortunately the exertion in the water began taking its toll much faster than even she expected. </div>

As they were reaching the diving point, he took out the rope from his pack and started to make some knots so he could drag his crew around. When he was done he went over the surface again to stop them and let them catch their breath, &quot;Alright idiots, that&#39;s enough. We are near the cave so here, put these around yourselves so I can drag you with me... One last warning, I ain&#39;t coming back for your sorry asses... So hold tight!!&quot; He threw them the rope that now had some belts that they could put around themselves, something like a climbing group would use to tie themselves together.

Just to mock them a little, he made a great show of putting the rope around his waist and securing it, it was a captain&#39;s duty to show his crew the way after all... </div>

With nimble fingers, the girl followed his lead, making sure the rope held her fast so that she wouldn’t be left behind once Garg started his swim. 

Once the rope was fastened in a way that satisfied Hal, she allowed herself a moment to rest and float. She was a little worried she wouldn’t be able to hold her breath long enough, but as before, plummeting into an element foreign to her body, she’d give it her all. After all, she didn’t want others to worry about her when there was a mission to complete. The girl chuckled inwardly at that. How easy it was to slip back into the mindset she knew. That of a spy, a would be assassin. An elf the matriarch would be proud of. How glad she was that Keth had opened her eyes to the hidden truth that was their lives. 

“Ready,” Hal sputtered against the rolling waves, as they lapped at her body, her fiery hair billowing on the surface of the water, while she floated and waited to proceed forward. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="08-Apr-20 10:54 AM">(edited)</span></div>

After what felt like an eternity but we&#39;re approximately 30 more seconds Garg reached the end of the cave and jumped out of the water, still dragging the others with him.

They landed on a small island, it was dark but they all could see thanks to the bioluminescent plants that were around the cave. 

And of course, a few seconds later their pursuer appeared with an angry roar, ready to get rid of the intruders... </div>

Narrowing her eyes, Hal shouted at the watery beast. “Coward! Lashing and singling out at those clearly not your own size!” There was an odd timbre to her tone, resonating with a darker magic than her previous bit of inspiration she’d sent Ford’s way. 

As her words struck at the creature, Hal then moved behind the coral situated in the middle of the small island. The girl glanced around trying to gain her bearings, her thoughts hopeful that her magic would aid the others when they had a chance to counter this beast’s attacks. </div>

One creature followed the wizard, while the other kept its sights on her. With a soft puff of air, Hal almost snarled at it. “I said... go... away...!” Her words laced with darker magic struck the beast and the thing fell down dead. The red head let out another sigh of relief. Only one creature was left. “Garg! Cheer! It went that way!” Hal pointed to the remaining beast, the creature screeching, knowing it would soon be done for. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Garg saw Cheer rush at the last creature and decided to finish this ridiculous fight. He took aim and fired, the bullet piercing the mud body and finally destroying the thing. &quot;There, was that so fucking hard to do?!&quot; He said loudly so everyone could heard him.

&quot;They fuck is wrong with ya all?! I asked you if you could fight, you all told me that you could fight!! So far only the mute idiot was the only one I saw fighting!!&quot; He kept yelling while pacing around, not really caring that everyone was kinda hurt from the fight.

&quot;And if you were going to uselessly throw magic around, couldn&#39;t you have done that while that big fucker was trying to eat us?! Fuck!!&quot; He had been scared too, after all sharkin were predators and they weren&#39;t used to have something else trying to eat them in the water. Specially not him that was one of the fastest swimmers alive. 

Just then he felt his body starting to calm down, the benefits of not having a heart anymore making themselves known once again, &quot;At least you were good cannon fodders...&quot; his voice turned into a growl once again as he visibly calmed down.

&quot;I&#39;m going to search for the stairs that are supposed not be around here, when I get back I expect you to be ready to fight once again...&quot; Was the last thing he said before he jumped into the water and dissapeared. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Hal knew enough from her time with the matriarch that one didn’t cross their leader until they were certain they had leverage. And even then... they often found a way to regain the upper hand. The girl thought about her last year, as Elvinor’s slave—becoming nothing more than a husk. Elvinor’s precious pet doing her bidding, while her brother awaited a fate potentially far worse than death. Keth would prefer death than to any reconditioning the matriarch might have had planned. Anything to keep Hal under her thumb and within Phiarlan’s spy circle. 

Just then, Hal shivered, a tear rolling down one cheek. The girl quickly wiped it away and looked over at Garg, her heart still racing after the swimming and fighting. She knew she’d done well, but this shark only focused on the negative. Mr Clay had said some guild members were... unique. And in her heart she knew something more was wrong. Unnatural. She’d figure out what, since even the meanest deserved a fair chance to be understood. She then looked at her unused crossbow and just smiled. A time would come when she’d use it again. Need it. But she was proud of her contributions thus far, especially in an environment her small elven body was not accustomed to. 

Raking her free hand through the wet tangles of red hair, Hal watched the shark go. He said he’d search for the stairs. And she’d remain put until his return. The girl looked over at the others, her blue eyes scanning the faces of people she’d just met and therefore didn’t know. The one was a fighter, seemed seasoned enough. Another had magic similar to her own, but he didn’t seem to understand it. Was he running from something? And then there was the one she’d healed. Another magic user, but different from herself. Something was odd there. It was just a matter of figuring out what exactly. At that, she sighed softly and hoped that Garg would return soon with news of having found those stairs. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="11-Apr-20 08:19 AM">(edited)</span></div>

                    <div class="markdown">Hal had been busily inspecting her own wounds when she heard Thrin’s voice. The red haired elf turned toward them, only to see Cheer move and touch the wizard, healing them with a magic she’d seen before. Both seemed content with the exchange, so she went back to inspecting herself, while the others made their talk. They all seemed so angry and it was obvious to her that none of them had been on missions before. Hal was no pirate, but she’d done her fair share in the way of espionage and even assassination to some degree. One thing was certain, they couldn’t press on like they had before. It hadn’t solely been Garg’s fault, but everyone’s for not communicating their strengths, their weaknesses, paying attention to each other. 

With a soft sigh, Hal decided her wounds would be all right if left alone. So, she quietly made her way closer to the group and then sat down. As she listened, her blue eyes watched both them and then the water for any sign of Garg’s return. The girl remained quiet, taking note of everyone’s behavior. Would it be the same once the shark came back? Probably not... she decided, though she kept it to herself. Pursing her lips, she hoped that everyone would settle and find their place in this rag tag rabble that Garg had taken to calling his crew. 

“We must find a way to make ourselves more prepared for next time,” Hal stated, her voice hushed and melodic. It sounded pleasant, as it echoed off the wet cavern walls. “Make sure we understand our arsenal and how we can work together.” She smiled then, her wet red locks draped over her slim shoulders. “I do know some magic,” she explained. “Some of it quite strong, allowing those with fight to capitalize should they seize the opportunity.” The girl hugged her knees to her chest. “I’m also quite good with my crossbow. How about all of you?” </div>

She nodded, not saying anything while the others just dropped their magical know-how upon her. It was a lot to process, some of which she was unfamiliar with entirely. But she got the gist—Cheer was new to his magic, still learning, while Thrin understood their weakness and that they were better suited from a distance. She eyed Ford then, the strongest amongst them all. A part of her didn’t envy that. It meant front lines. Always. 

“I see,” Hal then sighed, shifting a bit. “I know my own skills well. I am not a front runner. Nor am I one to sit idly by.” She brought one leg down, keeping the other bent. “But I’m helpful. Skilled. I can heal in a pinch and pack a punch to aid our silent friend over there.” The girl then gestured to Ford. “Think of me as your shadowy support.” She smiled then, knowing the shadows and darkness would always provide comfort, would always be ‘home’. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="12-Apr-20 10:55 PM">(edited)</span></div>

What was more, another elf would’ve found it insulting and stayed their words. So why did this one speak as much so freely? Something was off, but she didn’t know what. Furrowing her brow, she decided to let it go for the moment. They all had much more pressing things to worry about. 

Hal glanced back at the water then, wondering when Garg would return... how long was too long... She bit down on her lip, her teeth grazing the plump pink flesh, as it slid free from their grip. “Plan is easy,” she said calmly, her eyes moving from the water and then to her crossbow. “We protect the captain at all costs.” The girl assumed the others would know that their captain was Garg. “Our fighter leads the charge, while myself and Cheer support both him and the captain. We’ll be the watchers, aiding where need is highest. And you...” She turned towards Thrin. “Stay back and throw that magic when you can.” </div>

&quot;You were a joke and I thought you would handle yourselves better but You are in luck Idiots! I found the stairs and I recognize the place.

Instead, she focused on the potential exchange between captain and mute, wondering what would be revealed... or not. After a bit, she then added, “So what’s your plan then, captain?” At that, she shifted a little, her one hip jutting out, while her free hand gripped at it.

&quot;No.&quot; He just said and then opened his eyes once again, his hand dropping from his face and his gun appearing on it, the other one still holding his cutlass. &quot;Because you couldn&#39;t even be decent cannon fodder now you expect me to take hits for you?! I told you this already, I am not going to babysit you through this... That&#39;s stupid and I fucking refuse.&quot; He growled and them and then started to pace around. His tail thumped the ground a few times and an illusion with the layout of the fortress appeared in front of.the group. &quot;This is what I will give you. Now make a fucking plan or let&#39;s just storm the place.&quot; He said and stopped moving. He turned to face them once again and proceeded to explain the layout and explain how the pirates used the place as some sort of double tavern. One public for normal sailors and once secret for the real pirates, also explaining them how they used to fight properly in close quarters, trying to avoid setting things on fire (because there was booze and gunpowder everywhere and no one likes an explotion in the face) and finally how pirates use hit and run tactics instead of standing around like Idiots and wait for the enemy to attack. </div>

She wondered why everyone had dismissed her own suggestion, which had been to protect their captain and utilize their strengths given what each of them could do. In her heart and mind, she knew her plan had been sound. They were familiar tactics from back when she’d been a spy for the baron. 

“We should go with what I’d said originally,” Hal muttered, raking a hand through her fiery red hair. “Strength in front, casters on hold in the back. I am very quiet and able to hide well. Shadows and quick attacks are my specialty.” She sighed and then looked to Garg, who seemed both angry and frustrated. </div>

You don&#39;t like pain? Fine, be my guest and return to the guild where it&#39;s safe...&quot; He told them with a mocking grinn knowing that the only way to get out of here was swimming or fighting their way out. Talking about real pirates had helped him to calm down a little.

&quot;And you Shadow girl. Pick your words better, what&#39;s the difference between strength and a caster? I&#39;m <em>strong</em>..&quot; he said referring to Thrin words, &quot;and I can do magic. These idiots can barely fight, so you think they will figure out what you mean on their own?&quot; Fuck, he missed his crew. But the angry bosun had stayed at deep end with the weird gunner, and his first mate had run away with the idiot that had the nice rat. Scratch that, he missed his original crew, those assholes were real pirates at least, shame that they didn&#39;t survive the boss interview... </div>

He at least seemed okay with her suggestion even if he’d sneered at her execution in explaining. Her cheeks reddening, she dared to believe he thought her smart. It was a hopeful feeling, even if it was one made in vain. 

With a nod, Hal’s blue eyes moved to Thrin. Again, they referred to her as <em>elfy</em>... it was so odd. Jarring. Bordering on disturbing, especially when her own elven ears picked up on their bizarre accent. Narrowing her eyes, she dared to inspect closer, deciding Thrin might very well be hiding something. 

“Sorry, captain,” Hal then muttered. “I see what you’re saying.” At that, the red head lowered her gaze, but she soon tilted her face upward, her determination clear and etched in her features. “I’ll prove myself yet...” she then added in a whisper, hoping her actions might help bring her some peace she so sorely needed now that she was free from the baron’s clutches. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Hal listened to Garg finish and then followed after him. When they all reached the shallow water, she had to admit that she was getting used to being wet and soggy. The girl grinned inwardly. If only she wasn’t feeling cold. But she wouldn’t complain, since it wasn’t the worst she’d felt. Having worked for Elvinor Ellorenthi, she knew full well just how uncomfortable things could get. And this was a lovely stroll through a garden in comparison. 

As Hal trudged up onto the shore, she tilted her head so that her red tresses fell to one side. She then wrung them out and flipped them over her shoulder and down her back. As she righted herself, her blue eyes saw the door. The secret door. Her full lips pursed into a thin line, while she gazed in the door’s direction. Walking over to where the shark was waiting, she wondered if the door was sealed or rigged. If it was secret... no doubt whoever put it there would do everything to ensure only certain people would gain entry. 

“That door...” Hal began, her voice steady and low. “Do you know if it’s sealed by magic or rigged with traps?” Her eyes then slid to meet Garg’s. “I’ve seen some nasty traps on doors before, especially hidden ones. Magic traps, poison. All sorts. Perhaps we should check.” </div>

This arguing wouldn’t help any of them and it certainly wouldn’t help their captain get his ship. The girl bit her lip then and stepped closer to the fighting pair. 

“Bickering isn’t going to help,” Hal then said, placing herself between the supposed elf and the shark. “It will lead to stress, which will only make this task harder. We all came here to help the captain get his ship.” She paused then, noting Thrin’s behavioral features, suddenly not looking very elf-like at all. At least not to her eyes being obviously familiar with her own kind. “So that’s what we’ll do.”

Hal did her best to sound calm and collected, hoping her tone might help ease the tension. Back in the Feywild, she’d been considered a rarity, both in beauty and voice. So she hoped her voice did the trick if even for a few moments. “Cheer should nearly be done with his ritual... perhaps?” It was a question for the tiefling, the red head hoping Cheer’s magic was ready to test the door barring the way. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="16-Apr-20 08:55 PM">(edited)</span></div>

The girl hoped the magic worked, gave them what they needed. Like Garg, she wanted to go in quietly, keep surprise on their side. It was her favorite way to approach any situation when able.

                    <div class="markdown">Hal started inspecting the wall from the safety of her shadows. She sighed softly watching Ford act recklessly and without caution—a sure way to get himself and the rest of them killed. After she watched Thrin pull him back, she pursed her lips and went back to the wall in question. 

The wall was stone, but hot—at least at its center. The edges were cooler in comparison. It made the girl wonder just what sort of ‘thing’ lurked on the other side. Her blue eyes continued their inspection, finding a handle riddled with cobwebs. She neared the handle when Cheer announced finding the very same thing. 

Nearing the handle, Hal found herself wondering if the handle was enchanted, but then Thrin confirmed out loud that the wall itself was merely just that—a wall. Good. Hal wasn’t in the mood for a magical beast or entrapment, not when still feeling the effects of exhaustion from their earlier swim. Of course, that didn’t change the fact that she was sure <em>something</em> lurked in wait on the other side. It just meant it was one less layer of nonsense to worry about. 

Hal’s focus then turned back to the handle. She wondered if it was locked or rigged, could be used to open a well concealed door. Anything. Deciding to stay quiet and hidden, she carefully checked it out, knowing she’d either try to unlock it or disarm it... whichever was needed. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="22-Apr-20 10:14 AM">(edited)</span></div>

It was warm, not hot, so she brought her hand to the handle. While taking it in her grasp, she heard the others continue to act ridiculously... none of this was helpful. In fact, they were only ensuring they’d continue to have issues and eventually just all get killed. Well, that wouldn’t happen if she could help it. 

Though she was still quite tired, body aching from that swim, Hal dared to push and then pull at the handle. She had a feeling it could open and no matter how much any of them didn’t like it... they needed to get on the other side. As she tried the handle, she just didn’t have the strength to move it. 

Frustrated and wishing she’d fared better during the swim to the cave, Hal finally left the comfort of her shadows and scowled at the lot of them. “Unbelievable,” she muttered softly. “You fight and carry on, or do bizarre things rather than actually assess the situation and try...” She sighed then, placing her hands on her hips and looking down at the ground. 

“The wall doesn’t budge for me. Someone strong needs to try,” Hal then said, her voice steady and calm. “Strongest in front and so on. Those in back... hide.” Her scowl intensified. “And ready your weapons or magic.” <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="23-Apr-20 09:54 PM">(edited)</span></div>

Clearing her throat then, Hal stepped away from the door and headed back towards the others. She moved next to Cheer and muttered, “We should have the captain open the door.” A soft sigh passed over her lips. “He’s obviously the strongest.”

Hal looked up at the tiefling, hoping he’d get the hint and say something. She would back him the moment he did, as this was important and they had no choice but to somehow go through that strange door. </div>

The girl had often encountered other spies, assassins, snipers... all methodical. Calculating. Strategical. This was something else. Something other. Something she didn’t understand at all.

“Right,” Hal muttered, deciding it was lack of experience and being green around the gills that made things as they were right then and there. If only they’d been in a familiar terrain. She’d be so much more effective. But she’d make due. And she’d make their captain proud. Well, as proud as a unique creature such as he could be. At that she just smiled and raked a hand through her fiery red hair. 

“I’ll hide behind you,” Hal muttered to Garg, deciding that as their captain he should know. “But I’ll duck into the shadows. If anything comes at us from the other side, I promise to be ready.” The girl held up her crossbow, a means to show she’d be ready and try her best. At that, she smiled and slipped into those shadows she knew so well. </div>

He would have fired the magic cannon without a care but a deal was a deal. &quot;There&#39;s no need for words lover boy!&quot; The captain growled excitedly, &quot;You offered any gear and I happen to have a nice harpoon commissioned!&quot; 

&quot;Now, take a look how a fortress is properly stormed!&quot; He cheered before hitting the back of the cannon with his tail.

<strong>BOOM</strong> the big explotion of shadows happened, the cannon ball fitting the wall/secret door with enough pushing force to destroy whatever frame was holding it in place and pushed whatever was left of it 30ft forwards. In a couple of seconds the source of the heat was revealed to the party. Apparently Garg had just obliterated the inner wall of a giant oven. The sudden vacuum of air causing the fire to go out for a second before roaring to life once again when the void was filled with air once again.

Lucky for them the oven was destroyed in a way that all the burning fuel spilled from the brick structure into the kitchen&#39;a floors. The way forward now clear. The now messed up kitchen was filled with smoke and dust, not letting the adventures see who was there and also shielding them from the possible enemy eyes. </div>

Quietly moving around the room, she noted the stove and did her best to see if she could find a way through to another door or if there might be anyone waiting since surely someone had to have heard that loud boom. Unfortunately, the smoke caused just enough issue that she couldn’t tell. Being a cautious sort, she closed her eyes and pictured their captain, letting her thoughts somehow find his. 

<em>”Captain...”</em> Hal’s thoughts started, prodding the shark. <em>”It’s smokey in here and I cannot tell what’s about. Could you or another clear out the smoke?”</em> She hoped someone might be able to. <em>”I’m still hidden well and will cover you or anyone else should you need it.”</em> </div>

Just then, the message from the Shadow girl reached his ears and the grin widened even more. <em>&quot;No shadow girl.

It had been a short while since he had gone into a frenzy, last time being when he still had a beating heart. But the rush of invading a fortress to steal a nice ship was a close second.

He moved through the rubble, possing by tables, crates and a whole mess of cooking utensils that were laying around the place. Finally he found a door, a little fancier than he remembered but it has been a while and maybe the assholes liked fancy things. So with a shrug he kicked the thing open and stepped &#39;outside&#39; sure that he was moving towards the secret docks but instead ending up in what looked like an office and coming face to face with a couple of knights, their surprise faces quickly turned towards the door and surprised expressions immediately appeared when they saw what was there.

One was a male dragonborn and the other a human woman, and they both had obviously been rearranging their clothes and armor, a small indicator of what they had been doing in the office. </div>

After moving towards the sound, he saw what was making the sound. A couple of cooks were there trying to gather they bearings after the explosion. One was a round elf that was surely a knight by the armor he was wearing on his lower body, despite that everything else screamed &#39;chef&#39;, and the other was a small dwarven woman with what looked like a lot of cooking utensils tangled in her big mane.

The only bad thing that happened was that Cheer, without noticing, kicked a small pan that was laying on the floor, that sound alerting the cooks that someone&#39;s else was here.

&quot;Did ya hear that?!&quot; Asked the scared dwarf. &quot;Aye.&quot; Growled the elf and started to look around. &quot;Who&#39;s there?! Is that you Nash?! I told ya that oven had something funny in it!!&quot; </div>

She made mental notes about the things they passed, but she had to leave them alone. Her goal was to stay near the captain, be ready to aid should the situation arise. She soon watched him thrust open a door, her blue eyes catching sight of the Dragonborn and his woman. Immediately, she felt her face grow hot, her body feeling strange at having witnessed the interruption of an obviously intimate scene. Right then, she was glad to be still well-concealed in those shadows, so that no one—especially Garg—could see her embarrassment and notice her fluster. 

It took a moment before Hal gathered her wits and had her thoughts prod Garg’s once again. With a soft mental nudge, she sent him, <em>’I’m here right behind you. Ready if needed.’</em> She winced slightly, detecting the strange way her thought message projected to the shark. Ugh! Damn her inexperience in matters of intimacy! At least no one could see her blush. </div>

So, in an effort to avoid the particularly large elf and the dwarf, he slipped out of the room, leaving the pan where it was. He made a mental note about their faces. His goal now was to find himself in a situation where he finds one person, alone. He already had a scheme in mind to replace a Knight with himself, just as he did when trying to escape from guards when trying to steal food for himself or others. Put the guard to sleep, hide the body, and then use his Infernal abilities to essentially make things seem like nothing happened. But, he would be the mole.
He found himself disappointed that this was the extent of his prowess. If only I had a way to do things a proper mage would, he thought. Shoot magical energy from his palms, create a familiar. Everything he couldn’t manage to do in Lore Bard College. He probably should have gone to Sword college instead. </div>

He took a few steps I to the room before speaking to.the knights. &quot;Well, well... And here I thought that I would find a whole army ready to fight against the Boogeyman of the seas as I came to collect my ship... But it looks like they were more interested in <em>wrestling</em> with each other...&quot; He said mockingly before raising his gun and aiming it at the female&#39;s head. &quot;Fun&#39;s over and you have three seconds to tell me where you have docked the longship with the octopus flag before I blow your lover&#39;s brains out.&quot; He growled threateningly to the male while pointing at him with his Cutlass.

The half dressed woman didn&#39;t move. &quot;Whaaa?....&quot; She said softly. Her eyes were wide I&#39;m fear and her hands still holding her clothes in place were trembling a little. It was like her mind couldn&#39;t fully comprehend what was happening. </div>

Garg knew she was close behind thanks to her mental message and hadn’t revealed her presence, so she decided to continue keeping that to their advantage should this... predicament... suddenly go south. 

Carefully, quietly, Hal entered the room. Though she remained slightly behind Garg. As she neared the pair, she watched them carefully, trying to read them to see if they were trying to somehow turn the tables. But from what the girl could gather, they honestly seemed startled, so perhaps things were brighter than they appeared? No. No. She couldn’t trust that. She wouldn’t. So she remained at the ready and began scanning the room for any sign of weapons that these two might use against them. </div>

Garg just growled very loudly for s few seconds before speaking one again. &quot;Get fucking moving then!! Both of you!!&quot; And <strong>Boom</strong> he fired at the wall besides the woman, the impact making a small hole on the solid rock. &quot;Now!!&quot;

Sadly the intimidation tactics were not the best ones. The whole attack instead of making the knights fear him even more, just made them remember their training instead and the two of them jumped into action.
&quot;Tackle him!!&quot; The woman screamed and clapped her hands, using <strong>thaumaturgy</strong> to create some tremors in the ground. The dragonborn moved forward, his arms raised to tackle the shark.... Sadly his heroic move was thwarted by his still unfastened pants that had pooled on his ankles and made him fall on his face instead, just a couple of feet in front of Garg. </div>

The big elf had his pan raised, ready to hurt something while the Dwarf was obviously very scared and clinging to him but when she saw the young teen she released a relieved sigh, &quot;Look Tasty it&#39;s just a kid!&quot; She said pointing at Thrin.

The elf just scowled even harder and tightened the grip on his weapon. &quot;Don&#39;t be an idiot pepper!! No kid can do that! There&#39;s no kid in this God forsaken island... We rescued the civilians remember? And what tunnels?!!!&quot; Little by little the elf raised his voice more and more. The more he spoke the less believable sounded Thrin&#39;s lies.

It was then that a couple of steps could be heard from inside the cloud and the clone of the big elf appeared. The whole situation was so strange that the yelling elf just stopped doing it, his mouth still open while he scanned his clone. The poor confused dwarf had her hand clasped over her besting heart and she was moving her eyes from Thrin to Tasty to the disguised Cheer over and over again.... And <strong>Boom</strong> Garg&#39;s gunshot reached everyone&#39;s ears, making the situation even more confusing... </div>

Garg dropped his smile and now he was scowling really hard, &quot;No one lies to the Boogeyman of the seas!&quot; He roared while stepping over the fallen knight&#39;s head and touching his back with the tip of his shadow cutlass, making the dragonborn visibly tense.  &quot;Move just one muscle and you will become a skewed lizard!&quot;

The big elf eyes were showing the great level of anger and annoyance he was feeling, his face was red and he looked ready to explode but just as he was about to say something Garg&#39;s roar could be heard, the words couldn&#39;t be understood thanks to the distance and the strange tone he had that made him already difficult to understand when near him. The small Dwarf, that was still very confused, visibly jumped at the sound and grabbed the elf&#39;s leg once again. &quot;T-Tasty! Y-youuu said that there weren&#39;t any monsters left!&quot;

The big elf then scowled harder if that was even possible and started to speak, &quot;I don&#39;t believe you! I have two rules in my kitchen, No magic and no liars! And you just broke both!!&quot; And in his great anger he broke his own rules and with a wave of his pan summoned another one (spiritual weapon) that started hovering just over Cheer&#39;s head while the one still on his hand was ready to hit Thrin. </div>

She winced a little when she realized he’d given away that he wasn’t alone. Fortunately, the pair didn’t know where she was and were too preoccupied to really search. So quietly, she picked up the rope, the shark had absently tossed in her general direction and made her way over to the woman. 

As Hal neared the scene, rope in hand, she felt her face grow hotter and hotter. The woman was rather disheveled, her face still flushed from whatever the two had been doing before their unexpected intrusion. Briefly, her eyes caught sight of the dragonborn, his pants down, body exposed, and she immediately bit down on her lip. 

Hal blinked several times then, forcing herself to focus on the woman and the task at hand. She swallowed hard and finally revealed herself once standing next to the upset woman, her nimble fingers going to work on tying her up with the rope. “You and your partner will come to no harm if you just comply,” she explained softly gently, words to hopefully keep the woman agreeable despite the situation. </div>

Then after that he started to push the hostage towards the door, &quot;Shadow girl! keep an eye on the trickster, she tries anything, you cut her throat!&quot; The captain commanded and started to move.

Meanwhile with the other half of the party, the big had his eyes narrowed but was not doing anything else. He didn&#39;t look convinced at all but at least had not attacked. It was then that the Dwarf spoke, &quot;But how did you get past the scary monster?&quot; She wondered with an innocent expression.

Sadly for the mercenaries the big elf reacted after processing his companions words. &quot;That&#39;s it! You&#39;re going to the truth chamber!! Her movin&#39;. Now!!&quot; He stepped behind them and using the two pans (the magic and real one) to push the forward towards the directions that Cheer had just appeared from. </div>

For some reason, the shark had kept referring to her as a trickster. And, in the world she’d come from back in the Feywild, a trickster knee magic. Spells. As such, she wasn’t taking any chances that this woman would use magic against them all. 

Once satisfied with her work, Hal began nudging the woman forward. “Thank you for your compliance,” she reassured, simple words to try and keep the situation calm. She glanced over at Garg and the dragonborn. Things seemed under control there and the man was still unharmed, something she figured would help continue keeping the woman at ease. “This will be over soon. Promise.”

While they moved, suddenly Hal felt the tremors, the air shifting causing the smoke to clear. Something was happening. Something bad. Her gut knew it. As they entered the kitchen, a great monster began to materialize, so the red head stopped, remaining behind the woman while she processed just exactly what was going on. </div>

&quot;Get a hold of yourself pepper!&quot; He said more softly but in a still rough way and took a small water skin from his side and forced it on the sweating Dwarf&#39;s mouth while shielding her with his big body from the monster. &quot;I trained your for this, remember?&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Hal winced when the fiery monster appeared, the heat burning her porcelain pale skin. She felt her eyes water, the deep ache of being bone tired making her long for a soft bed and dim lights. But now wasn’t the time to dream. They were all in danger and giving in now wouldn’t do anyone any good at all. 

“Listen,” Hal then whispered to the woman she’d bound and gagged. “That monster will harm us <em>all</em> if we don’t work together.” The elf hoped her words were enough. “I do not wish to harm you or your male, but that <em>thing</em> does. I’ll free you and see about doing the same for your male if you help us... please...”

While Hal waited for an answer, she peered about the room. Not far off she was certain she’d seen both Thrin and Cheer. It wasn’t easy making out all the details given the confusion, but she’d seen enough. Recalling Thrin’s earlier fears, she focused her thoughts on the wizard and began to hum, the ethereal tune reaching them, giving them that little bit extra to hopefully ease those fears. One might say, Thrin was suddenly struck by inspiring thoughts and visions. But it would be up to them if they wished to harness it. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="07-May-20 09:00 AM">(edited)</span></div>

The female knight furiously nodded after hearing Hal&#39;s words and even managed mumbled something that sounded like a small prayer despite being restrained. Her slightly burned skin glowed a little and visibly healed in front of Hal&#39;s eyes. </div>

Cheer then looked back and saw Garg. Garg was likely one of the few people in the area who could take the monster head on. So, Cheer knew what to do.
“Remember, Garg,” Cheer sung. “You have a badass ship to take after this!”

She then perked up and set her sights on the guardian monster across the way. Aiming her crossbow, blue eyes unblinking, she let a bolt fire through the room. The piercing bolt found its mark, striking the beast in the back, his injuries starting to look fairly severe. The elf huffed a sigh of relief and immediately took cover in the shadows, moving slightly away from the little group she was with. Her hope was that a new location might disorient the creature, making her next attack—should she even need to make one—count all the more. Blue eyes scanning everything, crossbow still at the ready, she waited to see what unfolded next. </div>

Anyone that would be paying attention would notice how most of the elf&#39;s burns and wounds healed and Tasty looked less pained.

&quot;What are you doing?!&quot; He asked after catching his breath but she refused to answer.

Another roar from the almost destroyed guardian shook the room and the female knight that Hal just released rushed forward. &quot;Tasty, pepper!!

&quot;So y&#39;all think this is a fuckin joke!!!!&quot; He roared and raised his gun again, but this time the sounds of lighting were coming from inside the barrel. &quot;I am Garg fuckin DreadStorm!! The Boogeyman of the seas!! I was having fun with ya but no more!!! Here&#39;s what dread feels like!!!&quot; And he fired. First what the flash of blue/white intense light, then after a second... <strong>BOOM</strong> a deafening explotion, something so loud and stunning that very few had experienced in their lives.

A few more seconds passed before a rough evil laugh was heard. &quot;Fuck!! Haha!! That asshole Draq sure was right &#39;bout it!!&quot; 

The monster had exploded, and all the knights, that somehow had all aligned for this awful outcome to happen, were in the floor with their eyes open and twitching in pain. A few more seconds passed before the collar of the penalty started to form around their necks and all the while the shark never stopped laughing. </div>

Just then, she watched nearly everyone go down—the monster, the cooks... even the captain and his lady. Her face blanched and she swallowed hard processing what had exactly happened. It was then that the girl noticed the collars. She’d seen them enough times to know exactly what they were. And it meant they could get their ship... and hopefully leave the little crew behind relatively unscathed. 

Biting down on her lip, Hal moved forward out of the shadows. She then approached the Dragonborn captain. “No one will be hurt and we’ll be on our way shortly. We just...” The elf looked over at Garg, licking her lips, fear and something else making her mouth go dry. “We need a ship. A specific one called <em>Shadow Squid</em>,” she explained. “We get that, then we leave. We won’t bother you again.” </div>

However, what Garg said before giving the big shock reminded him of how Garg complained about the rest not doing enough. And now he wanted the attention, which had not been given to the others. Sure, he had screwed up sometimes, but it never hurt to be cautious once in a while, right? Cheer walked up the the big blue sharkin to have a talk.

The dragonborn was in a similar situation, only he was more aware of himself than the Dwarf. &quot;... Don&#39;t know... <em>Cough</em>... What you&#39;re... Talking about... <em>Chough</em>... But... There&#39;s a couple... <em>Cough</em>... Of ships... Docked here...&quot; Then with the little strength he had, the knight managed to shake his head. &quot;Won&#39;t matter... We... Trapped here...&quot;

The laughing Garg took a couple of more seconds to keep gloating. He was really loving this whole not having a heart business. No more unnecessary frenzies. All his instincts were under control. And he could focus his power in better and very dangerous ways.

The shaking finally stopped laughing and addressed the tiefling. &quot;Ah bet those couple neurons ya have in there are about to burn out aren&#39;t they, lover boy?&quot; Garg answered mockingly before his whole expression and voice turned serious and rough once again. &quot;It&#39;s Captain DreadStorm to you.

The girl knew something odd was going on, but in the moment, it wasn’t overly relevant. Remaining quiet, she chose not to acknowledge the comments and instead focused on the task at hand. If they got things over quickly, the silver knights could be on their way, allowed time to recover, and they’d have completed their task—a win for all.

Checking over the injured, Hal just nodded. “Shh... don’t strain yourself too much,” she began. “The intent wasn’t to injure anyone, just to retrieve a ship.” The girl looked over at the healer woman, her expression soft. “Do you have it within you to heal yourself and the others? At least enough so you can walk?” She then turned back to the Dragonborn. “If we could look at your ships, we can see if any are the one we seek.”

Suddenly, Hal looked up at Garg. She knew in her heart that she’d stayed true to herself and the mission. Despite the odds being against her the entire time she’d done her part and had done it well. She’d have changed nothing she’d done. Her blue eyes narrowed then and she shook her head. “They can take us to look at the ships,” she stated flatly. “They need to be healed some so they can show us. But they claim we are trapped. Whatever that means.” She turned back to the Dragonborn, her expression requesting that he explain. </div>

&quot;Stop being such a whimpering shithead, Cheer.

Meanwhile a strange expression appeared on the sharkin&#39;s face, it was like he had &#39;raised an eyebrow&#39; but looked weird. <em>Are these idiots for real?</em> He thought. He was used to insult people just for the heck of it, it was fun after all... But looking at this display, it seemed that the only one that wasn&#39;t so useless was the shadow girl since she was still focused in the real target here.

Finally Garg sheated his Cutlass and gun, and crossed his arms over his chest before shaking his head a little and starting to walk forward. &quot;I seem to remember...&quot; He started to say with his usual growly voice that always sounded angry. &quot;... That I recruited fighters... To fight these knights.&quot; As he moved forward, his eyes started to scan the room, noticing the door that Cheer had uses to get out of the kitchen.

&quot;You all agreed... <strong>To fight the knights.</strong>... And I also seem to remember... That you all wanted <strong>to steal the gold from the knights.</strong>... And now you want to help them instead??&quot; Finally he came to a stop in front of Thrin, Cheer and the Dwarf. He remembered how the female had healed the round knight so before they had a chance to react, he unsheathed his sword and slashed the Dwarf&#39;s apron open, releasing some pastries that she had in the front pocket. </div>

That, is the difference between <em>me</em> and <em>all of you.</em> And if you want to keep having to tongue so you can whine...

The girl nodded then, a hand raking through wild red tendrils. “Eat up,” she then urged, just ignoring the spat and focusing on the task. The sooner the knights could walk, the sooner they’d have their ship. “It’ll make you feel better.

                    <div class="markdown">Hal hadn’t had time to search for valuables yet. Her entire focus had been the mission and keeping everyone alive. But now that things had quieted and the knights were under the effects of the penalty, she’d see about such things, as they’d be escorted to the ships the Dragonborn had mentioned. 

With an audible sigh, Hal then just eyed the wizard, but she didn’t outright address their question. Instead, she just shook her head, red curls mostly dry and hanging down along her back. Why Thrin would ask such things out loud baffled her. Then again, perhaps discretion wasn’t their strong suit. Maybe it was why they were always so afraid? It was hard to say. 

At that, Hal helped hoist up the nearest knight and gestured the others do the same. Once everyone was situated, she let her blueeyes scan the room—the now very wrecked kitchen. 

“Show us to your ships,” Hal then stated, her voice calm and soothing. Pleasant. The girl saw no need to taunt the knights. After all, they’d tried to help once that monster had appeared. And she wasn’t about hurting people if there were alternatives present. She’d caused enough strife for others in her past. </div>

&quot;As the highest authority in this outpost... I thank you for your kindness.&quot; The dragonborn thanked Hal and Thrin while helping his liver to stand up. 

The big elf just grunted something under his breath and took the Dwarf from the floor and checked her over. 

They were all worse for wear and their clothes had the burned marks where Garg&#39;s lightning went through them. Either by their own tiredness or the collar around their necks, no knight tired to do anything else and just remained quiet waiting for the penalty to be defined. Though both males kept their eyes on the party, specially on the shark.

Then the dragonborn spoke once again, after a few seconds of silence. &quot;Before we move forward and take you to the docked ships... Please, offer us another small drop of kindness and state the penalty. These collars block our connection to the holiness and it&#39;s very... <em>Restrictive.</em>&quot; </div>

Moving forward with the suggestion Thrin had for her explaining their need moments ago, she gently placed a hand on the Dragonborn’s shoulder, her expression soft and full of empathy. “I apologize for the discomfort,” she stated softly, her voice resonating a pleasant timbre. “This will be over soon and we won’t bother you again. My word.” She then gave them all a smile and took a step back. Her eyes looked over at Garg briefly and she was certain the shark was judging her every word and her every action. No matter. She was sure there were reasons he’d ended up this way. 

Focusing once more on the knights, Hal sighed and bit down on her lip. “We will search this place and take what we want,” she started. The girl knew the knights were aware of their want for a ship, but perhaps not stating so would make it easier for them to take anything else along the way that might prove useful later. It was something at least. 

“Once we have it,” Hal then continued. “We will leave as promised. But what we need from you is while we search and then finally leave, that you and those affiliated with you will leave us to our business, causing us no harm or trouble. Our time here and after with you and your allies must not be hindered.” The girl searched the knights’ faces, hoping that they might actually agree and not merely comply because of the penalty collars. “We do not want any others—knights or our own—to suffer injury.”

At that, Hal looked to Garg and nodded. “Let’s go find those ships. There’s a dock somewhere.” As she spoke, her eyes began scanning, looking for anything that might be of value to take with them. </div>

&quot;Get moving then... Before the last piece of patience I have <em>sails away.</em>&quot; He growled to the knights.

&quot;It&#39;s not like it would go anywhere...&quot; Grumbled the big elf, still holding the Dwarf in his arms. &quot;And don&#39;t worry girlie, we&#39;re trapped here... All by ourselves.&quot;

&quot;... Yes, you shall not worry about our fellow knights...&quot; Started to say the dragonborn before starting to walk out of the kitchen, &quot;My love... Why don&#39;t you explain to our... <em>Guests</em>... The predicament that we found ourselves in while I show the way to the docks.&quot; He said to the female human.

While the all followed the dragonborn, the woman explained as requested. </div>

You see, we were part of a liberation platoon, we came after our scouts told us that some pirates were distributing unholy magic items and were using this...&quot; She gestured to the building around them, &quot;... As their main base.&quot;

&quot;After we liberated this place from that pirate scum, we found that they had made something to this place... Something that not even our magic could completely nullify. If there&#39;s too much magic released, of we try to escape or someone tries to come to the island, an elemental guardian appears. We four had to sacrifice ourselves distracting the storm guardian so our platoon could return home to seal some of the items we found.&quot; Then she frowned and started bitting her lip, before continuing, venom practically coming from her mouth now. &quot;<em>It was all for nothing</em>... <em>Those bastards sealed the main vault and we were left with mere scraps</em>... <em>And we became prisoners instead</em>... <em>That&#39;s what we got for doing our holy mission and making this land safer</em>...&quot;

At that Garg, that was following at the back of the group, started laughing once again. He didn&#39;t say anything, just laughed and walked. </div>

She arched a brow at the mentioning of a sealed vault—what if that held what Garg was looking for? He’d mentioned something about the undead... she was sure her memory was correct in that. Plus, from what she’d read about these Silver Knights in the library the night before they left for this island... she knew they followed the undead, had magic to vanquish and still them. 

Slowly, Hal was piecing together everything she could with the information she had. Just then, the girl cleared her throat, a hand flicking red curls over her shoulder. She glanced over her shoulder at the shark man and then looked forward again, gasping softly. “I want to see this sealed vault for myself,” she then stated. “See if we can figure out why it couldn’t be opened before.” </div>

&quot;Tha vault in the opposite way... I would show you the way there but... The penalty is forcing us to go to the docks.&quot; Said the human woman, &quot;you will see the big door of the vault... Very hard to miss.&quot; And gave Hal a small smile before the collars pulsed and the group of knights was forced to keep walking towards the docks.

Garg just kept laughing and following the group, his Cutlass still unsheathed and ready in case they tried something. He had a personal grudge against that goddess so he didn&#39;t trust the penalty.

After a few minutes, the main group would reach the small docks where only a couple of small ships remained and one of them was the one that Garg had shown the party before.

Hal would easily reach the end of the corridor and see the big door guarding the supposed treasure. </div>

She knew this whole ordeal would be over soon and the group could get back to their lives. Though, a part of her felt badly that they somehow believed themselves to be prisoners of the small island. As she made her way to the door, she couldn’t help but wonder if they could still somehow work together... unseal the treasure, leave and each reunite with their own. It was a gamble, but worth it. But first she needed to know more about this door. 

“<span class="spoiler spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"><span class="spoiler-text">Reveal</span></span>...” Hal then whispered out loud in Elvish. A soft glow seemed to wash over her, finally settling upon her bright blue eyes. The girl blinked then, her eyes focusing on not just what was there, but also... what was not. As she adjusted, she began scanning the area, her focus on the door and the area surrounding it. If anything strange, or even ethereal, was hidden there, her eyes would now see it. </div>

The luminescent glow was almost painful, but she pushed herself past that and was able to tell enough that what she saw was more than likely words. With a soft sigh, she just frowned then, knowing that whatever the words were, they were beyond her understanding and knowledge. She’d need help. Someone who understood just what it was she was looking at. Pursing her lips in frustration, she knew her only option was to go find the others and hopefully get them to return with her. Maybe then they could better solve this strange mystery.

While Hal moved through the knights’ base, she knew she had to hurry. Though she had a good amount of time before her spell wore off, she was hoping not to have to recast it once again, at least not before a good long rest. Meandering the various hallways and corridors, she finally managed to find Thrin who’d seemed occupied with something or other. Deciding that could wait, she just cut to the chase immediately. “I’ve been looking for all of you,” she began. “I... I have found something and I think it could lead to a great reward for each and every one of us.” The girl paused just a moment to quiet her mind. “That door the woman spoke of that’s sealed. There’s definitely some kind of magic going on only... there were glyphs. And I cannot read them. If we go back, I could draw what I see if anyone has paper.” The girl shifted her stance. “But there’s more. Nature magic seems to not like certain areas here. Little beings were avoiding the armory, the well in the main courtyard, and the docks themselves.” She frowned then. “Did Garg find his ship, by the way?” she suddenly asked, hoping the shark man was at least able to get what they’d all come looking for. </div>

And then, if we reunite them with their friends, perhaps we could gain favor for us and the guild. Might be nice to have allies on a future job,” she explained, her lips quirking you into a smile. “But first... those glyphs. I need paper and ink.” </div>

As they moved through the hallways, she reiterated her hope, though her thoughts turned to those knights for a moment, no doubt keeping company with Garg. She bit down on her lip then, teeth scraping plump flesh.

“I think if we work with those knights we might open it,” Hal said. “The treasure we could all gain...” The girl hoped this appealed to the volatile wizard. After all, they only could gain here... not lose. “It would definitely be a mutual benefit. We all gain some treasure and in return for the help, we reunite their group.” She licked her lips, turning the corner that led to the strangely sealed door. “Imagine guaranteed favor and protection from the knights. An easy and reasonable gain, wouldn’t you say?”

Hal looked at Thrin, hoping they agreed. It was honestly the smartest choice and the wizard didn’t seem to be the sort to overlook the obvious. Hope in her heart, she then brought Thrin to where the glyphs were flowing brightly. At least for her now enchanted eyes. “They are right there,” she explained. “If I could have the paper and ink, I’ll draw them.” </div>

The girl concentrated on her lines, the way the pen scratched against the paper. She chewed on the inside of her cheek, eventually tasting the metallic tang of fresh blood upon her tongue. At the jolt of pain, the girl grunted softly. But she kept biting at the tiny wound, the dull pain keeping her grounded and in the moment. Just then, a small drop of blood dripped onto the paper, her eyes widening, as her finger moved to brush it away. A smear remained, but it didn’t ruin the glyphs she’d drawn up. Once done, she held up the paper up for Thrin to see and shook her head. “We both go. I need to talk to the knights anyway. We need a plan and better to rest before attempting anything with that door. Perhaps we can stay the night and try opening the vault in the morning.” At that, Hal looked to Thrin to lead the way back to the knights. </div>

At this point he had already lost all respect for them, only the shadow girl had some because she never lost focus of the mission and she has the balls to search for what she wanted, but even then, she too was close of losing that.

Garg then raised an eyebrow at the display. He was sure that if he out his mind to it, he could find that treasure but he would let the idiots stumble around for a little while.

The prisoners were quiet. Despite the display they weren&#39;t struggling or anything and when Hal passed the paper in front of them the Dwarf visibly perked up. &quot;Tasty! That&#39;s what we did so the island wouldn&#39;t suck our meat and leave us all skinny!&quot;

The big elf just nodded with a grunted, &quot;Aye...&quot;

Garg then just chuckled once again, &quot;There won&#39;t he any deal shadow girl. You&#39;re all looking at my new crew. 10 years of service for their freedom.&quot; Explained the shark, feeling proud of himself. &quot;You want a deal, you come at me.&quot; He finally said and that evil grin returned to his face.

One more disrespectful word and we will see how you will manage to talk without vocal cords...&quot; He growled threateningly. How little you know how things work around the seas... It&#39;s fuckin impressive.&quot; Garg growled once again before taking a step back and sheating his weapon.
&quot;A crew for a job is different than a crew for this ship...&quot;

Then he turned towards Hal and smiled once again. &quot;You have balls shadow girl. Looks like you elves have potential... My last first mate was like you... Before she ran away with that jumpy sailor wannabe, awful aiming but the big rat was useful at least.&quot; He sounded more light before his already dark growly voice took a darker tone and he used his now free hand to rub his chest, where his sharkin heart was supposed to be. &quot;<em>The stupid things idiots do for love</em>...  <em>Good thing that I&#39;m now free from that.</em>&quot;

After a few seconds he just shook his head and looked at the knights, &quot;Answer the shadow girl, I want to hear about this.&quot;

 The big elf grunted and his grumpy face got angry. &quot;It&#39;s no what it says, it&#39;s what it does. That is a containmet field made by glyphs. A pressure boiler keeping the evil thing from sucking all the life from this whole island.&quot; He explained before the Dwarf giggled and added to it, &quot;Me and Tasty were the only ones that could get close! We had to cook a ton of tasty food afterwards!&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Hal just watched and listened as Garg spoke, her shimmering blue eyes following his hand when it went to his chest. “Free?” she whispered, perplexed as to what he meant. And why did he seem so bitter about love? Was that what made him this way? The girl thought for several moments, knowing this was yet another mystery she needed to solve. But not before the one facing them all. As much as she wanted to understand this new piece of the puzzle, they had to sort this particular problem out first. 

“So, you could get close to it?” Hal reiterated, wanting Pepper to say more. “Just what is it that you’ve contained? Your fellow knight here...” she gestured to the Dragonborn’s lady. “Made it sound like the pirates had sealed it. So, which is it and why. If we work together on the door and whatever beast or magic holds you prisoner together, perhaps we can split the treasure, and...” her voice trailed a moment. “On our way back, we can see about helping you reunite with your friends. In return, we’d want an alliance. Should we need aid in the future, you’ll help.”

It was a fair and reasonable deal. Hal knew this. But she still didn’t know the full story about the evil Pepper was speaking about. “So please, explain further. Afterwards we can rest and in the morning once refreshed we can come up with a sound plan.” The girl looked back at Garg then, biting once more on the cut on her inner cheek. The little jolt kept her in the moment, so she slid her gaze back to the knights and waited patiently for them to elaborate even more. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="18-May-20 12:05 AM">(edited)</span></div>

&quot;Food always helps!&quot; Cheered pepper before letting Tasty continue.

&quot;We don&#39;t know what&#39;s there. The pirates did something before fleeing. It was a trap all along.&quot; At that he shook his head in dissapointment. &quot;Captain DreadStorm already promised us freedom in exchange of labor... I don&#39;t plan on returning to the silver knights, not after this but... We can try to open it and stop that darkness. I believe there&#39;s something there that keeps forming the guardians by feeding on the magic and nature.&quot; All the while the other knights remained silent, their tired eyes looking down. The Dwarf became visibility sad at the mention of the silver knights but then she perked up a little when the elf finished, &quot;I&#39;ll help too! Lots of food so you don&#39;t get all skinny!&quot; </div>

Well, their choices were their own. But working together on that vault seemed like it might benefit them all. Though not before a good night’s rest. 

“Perhaps we can all reconvene in the morning,” Hal suggested. She was bone tired and in great need of rest. Her mind would be clearer, her body refreshed once she got some sleep. “Do you have some extra rooms we could use? If space is an issue, we can always share a room. We’ll just be glad of the hospitality.” 

At that, Hal moved back along the docks, hoping the knights would show them all where they could sleep for the night. Tomorrow would be a long day. They needed their strength, their cunning. They all needed to be at their best. </div>

What part of strike hard and fast you idiots didn&#39;t fuking understand!!&quot; He said looking very angry, more than usual to the point that his tail was trashing around without control behind him.

Well... This raid had been going great for him so far despite everything. He had managed to secure a free weapon for him and a small crew for his longship. And he was sure that whatever was in that vault would be useful to him. So, after grumbling around angry for a few minutes he made a decision. &quot;Fucking fine! I want y&#39;all idiots here at first light!!&quot; He yelled at Hal and the knights before jumping into the sea. He was going to enjoy being at home while he could.

The Dwarf just giggled after listening to the elf groan in annoyance. &quot;Uhmmm... There&#39;s a lot of room in the fortress but...Could you please release us... Again?&quot; Asked the female human at Hal, she was blushing very brightly and the dragonborn looked embarrassed too while the grumpy elf just made a gesture with her head towards the rope that had them all restrained. </div>

The collars slowly dissipated from around the knights’ necks, Hal’s lips then curving upwards into a smile. “Why don’t we all rest.

And each into what was obviously shared rooms. It wasn’t difficult to piece together just what would be occurring behind those closed doors, the thought causing the girl to blush nearly as red as her hair. Skin feeling hot, she wondered what it might be like to find another. One who cared about you, as much as you did them. She’d never experienced such affection... not counting Keth or Ettrian, of course. But... that was different. So very different. 

Again, Hal found herself biting down on her cheek. The pain causing her to groan softly, while moving further down the hallway. She finally found an empty room, the place clean enough and the bed larger than expected. In the corner, she saw a mirror hanging above a stand and wash basin. After closer inspection, it was clear she’d need to draw some water. 

Hal stretched then and placed her belongings on the floor beside her bed. Her blue gaze lingered on her crossbow and rapier. She hadn’t used either much since going on this adventure. In fact, she questioned if she was doing anything right at all. It was a different feeling than those she’d had when she’d been a part of Baron Elvinor’s inner circle spy ring. Carefully, she laid down her studded leather armor, her top hanging loosely about her skin shoulders. She looked more relaxed, hair wild from drying oddly thanks to the salt water and salty air. At that, she picked up the basin and set out to get some water from the well. </div>

She could recall the strangeness of the spot when her eyes still shimmered and had been able to peer into the Ethereal Plane. At this point, she was used to alternate realms, being from the Feywild herself. But her homeland was torn asunder with war and politics. It was never good for anyone when the Seelie and Unseelie Courts decided to seal their disagreements in... blood. 

Hal sighed then, cautiously, quietly padding to the well, basin in hand. She set the thing down and moved to lower the bucket. The pulley worked easily enough and soon her basin was full. Carefully, she picked it up and began making her way back to her room, cheeks flushed as she thought on what was going on behind at least some of those doors.

Once settled in her room, Hal washed up and finally snuggled down deep into the covers of her bed. It was so soft and welcoming, the girl easily finding sleep the moment her head hit the pillow. When next she opened her eyes, it was morning. It would be a long day for them all, she figured. But she was hopeful they’d manage to open the vault. She slid out of bed, made it and then went to the basin to wash her face. The girl shivered a little from the chill of the water. When done, she dressed and grabbed her belongings. Ready to face the day. At that, she left to meet up with everyone, eager to solved the vault mystery and then finally get back to the Steel Heart. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="21-May-20 07:58 PM">(edited)</span></div>

What was surprising was the big bonfire in the small beach besides the wooden structure. And even more surprising was the sight of Garg getting out of the water with several fishes and handing them to Tasty and pepper, who quickly started to prepare them to be cooked. The dragonborn and the human were sitting on the sand, quietly chatting between them.

&quot;Well?... Is the cannon fodder ready for another day of stumbling around like Idiots?&quot; Oviously the nice picture had to be broken by the voice of the sharkin. </div>

It was wild with sea spray, a fiery halo adorning her pretty head. Pushing the blankets off her slim body, she swung her legs over the side of the bed and got up. She padded toward the wash basin and washed her face. After drying it with a towel, she put on her pants and boots, her armor and then slung her backpack over her shoulders. Once ready, she made her bed and head out into the hallway. 

It didn’t take long for Hal to find Garg and the knights. Her senses were immediately bombarded with the smells of cooking fish and camp fire. It was a pleasant aroma and made her mouth start to water. Just then, her tummy rumbled, her cheeks reddening a little from embarrassment. As she approached the group, she smiled prettily, nodding at everyone. Her way of saying ‘good morning’.

“Hello. Good morning,” Hal spoke softly. “Hope everyone slept well. Thanks again for your hospitality.” </div>

Cheer got up quietly, so as to not disturb anyone. After some stretching and some sitting, he smelled his clothes. Given how they have been with him since a little before the job began, he felt the need to get a change of clothes himself.
Either way, he considered himself ready enough. He went out to go find where everyone was to be. He followed the smell of fish to where Hal, Garg, and the pirates were.

The elf handing the actual cooking just grunted and pointed towards some pieces that were already done. &quot;Eat.&quot; Was all he said and kept doing his thing.

The other couple just made some small nods of acknowledgement and quietly greeted the newcomers before the dragonborn grabbed a big piece for both of them and they started to eat.

Garg just growled after hearing Thrin&#39;s words but decided to ignore it for now. Spending the night in the sea and actually having a great sleep for once made him have a good mood and he won&#39;t let anything ruining it. He just dropped one of the big fishes he had and then sat down on a rock to eat quietly eat the other one. Raw. </div>

She gave another nod to Tasty and Pepper, smiling a bit. “I think you’ll both enjoy the Steel Heart,” she said softly, genuinely believing the pair could find a nice home for themselves on board. “Anyway, I’m ready to check out that vault whenever everyone else is.” Her hands moved to adjust her pack, crossbow ready, rapier on her hip. The girl’s mind swam with the strange magic she’d learned back in the Feywild, the darker magic ready to aid her friends and allies. </div>

Pursing her lips, she then nodded. “Of course it will.” The girl paused then before asking, “So where did you say you studied magic?” The red head glanced at Thrin, continuing on before they could answer. “I’m guessing the Feywild, as it’s where all the elves study. Well, any who want to be taken seriously.” Her expression turned dreamy, her hand reaching up to twist some of her hair about a finger. “So no doubt that’s where you went. Right?” </div>

He became really interested when shadow girl started to question the annoying one and he actually snorted, very loudly, when he heard Thrin saying that they were smart and good at what they did.

&quot;Your brain must have stayed in the airship then... and you must be good at complaining and being annoying and useless...&quot; He growled after his fish was no more, not even bones remaining. He stood from his rock and started to walk towards the group. &quot;Finish eating quickly, we lost a day in this place because that treasure. I plan to sail as soon as possible.&quot; He told the former knights. 

The dragonborn and the woman had been quietly eating and chatting among themselves, mostly talking about their own future now that they had one and it was no longer tied to the knights. Tasty and Pepper had been completely different though, they had been devouring their food in a very similar way to Garg, it seemed that they knew how to enjoy food and don&#39;t leave anything on their plates, even the small bubbly dwarf was making a very unpleasant show of no eating manners. </div>

It was obvious now that Thrin knew <em>nothing</em> of elves or even half elves for that matter. As a member of Phiarlan, she was well aware of the Lyrandar family. Like her own, they were also dragonmarked. Storm Keepers, a powerful ally at times. And at others, the worst sort of enemy. But every elf knew... half elves saw just as well as they did in the dark. “I... see...” was all the red head said, dropping her hand from her hair. Thrin’s slip up would be noted. And oh yes, they’d be spoken to about it when the time was right. But for now, all she did was nod and smile, readjusting her pack and turning towards Garg. “Well, you ready, Captain? I hear a vault calling us.” </div>

She was certain now, no doubt in her mind. And she’d make it a point to find out the why of these things. After all, it would only help to better understand her guild mates.

Garg had remained in the back of the group, arms still crossed over his chest and flintlock still in his left hand. He observed the ominous door and raised an eyebrow but otherwise remained silent...

With a heavy sigh, she just turned away from Tasty and Pepper, now doubting if either would be of assistance should they prove to need it. “We don’t have much choice,” she then conceded, answering Thrin’s question, though her tone indicated this did not sit well with her one bit. At that, she just slowly approached the barrier and dared a step beyond it... waiting to see if she felt anything resembling what the knights had mentioned earlier. And also hoping that the others in the group actually followed. If there was any strange magic seeping from the door, the girl hoped Thrin—being a wizard—might think to check if they could sense anything.

Pepper looked like a scolded child while Tasty just looked as grumpy as ever, glaring at both Hal and Thrin. </div>

Reminiscing on how all Thrin did was hide and take credit for others ideas, while Cheer oftentimes didn’t even understand his own spells... perhaps he’d get along with the cooks then, she silently mused. Rolling her eyes then, she turned towards Garg. She nodded at his words, crude, but she understood what he’d meant. 

<em>”Don’t worry, Captain,”</em> Hal prodded through her mind. <em>”I very much plan to get the treasure. Make no mistake.”</em> She gave the shark a crooked smile then, refusing to acknowledge the others for now—let them pull teeth, while trying to talk to the dunder-head pair—and crossing her arms beneath her breasts. If Thrin wanted to figure it out... let them. And they better not crawl to her for healing help if anything should go wrong. </div>

After a couple of minutes she was done and the words: Seal, Power, Life, Mirror and Pressure were the ones written over and over in a seemingly random order over and over again. &quot;Done!&quot; She finally declared and handed them back everything.

With a soft sigh, Hal just closed her eyes, trying her best to stay calm and focused. It wasn’t helping that people were starting to claim she was stupid or something to mock and demean. Quite bothered, she returned Tasty’s glare. “Did I wrong you in some way?” she finally spat at the elven cook. Though, at this point she didn’t expect an answer.

                    <div class="markdown">Hal immediately closed her eyes the moment she saw Cheer toss his rock. Honestly, it was the last straw for her... oh to finally be back home on the Steel Heart. Exasperated, she felt the tremor, but her elven heritage allowed her to find her balance, avoiding a fall once the floor split itself open. She watched Thrin and Tasty fall down to the floor below. Neither were terribly injured, she’d clearly endured worse testing the clerics’ barrier. Looking at Garg, she then frowned, her mind prodding his once more. <em>”Someone needs to put that one on a leash. Unbelievable...”</em> Her blue eyes flit towards the tiefling very briefly before returning back to the shark. 

“This is quite a predicament,” Hal then sighed, raking her hands through her fiery red hair. “We need to find that other entrance you mentioned. Was there a room we missed and didn’t see?” she then asked. “Perhaps we need to investigate further.” </div>

&quot;Tasty! Are you ok? Do you need a snack?!&quot; Asked the concerned Dwarf while looking down at the ones that fell.

Tasty just grumbled and got into his feet. &quot;No.&quot; He just answered before his eyes narrowed. &quot;Wizard! Be in you guard!&quot; He yelled a Thrin and grabbed his weapons.

Just then the pieces of stone that had fallen started to vibrate and they started to pull the big rocks of the cave in towards them. In just a couple of seconds 3 creatures formed from the rocks. Luckily for the party they had cleared the way towards the secret docks, the sounds of the ocean filling the building... But then the creatures finally started moving and they didn&#39;t seem friendly at all. </div>

Unfortunate for his legs, though, as they pained him enough upon landing that he fell forward. He caught himself before falling face first, at least. He then stood up, facing the monsters.

For a brief moment, the girl looked at Garg, searching for some sort of... reassurance? She wasn’t quite sure why. Perhaps it was the adrenaline coursing through her, the fact that the floor had torn itself apart. Just then, her attention was brought back to the hole. She saw Thrin hurl some sort of magic at those rocky beasts. Whatever it was, it had struck true and was enough to cause some damage. 

At that, Hal swallowed hard and moved closer to the hole’s edge. She was able to get a good look at all three beasts down below. It was then that her hands started to glow, soft shimmering lavender emanating slowly. The red head then narrowed her eyes at the beasts, the light suddenly leaving her and moving towards the beasts. It wasn’t long before the creatures were engulfed in the purple-colored light, lit up enough to give everyone there an advantage they hadn’t had before. 

As Hal watched the creatures shimmer, she couldn’t help but smile a little. Her lips curving in a slightly lopsided way. The girl let out a soft breath then, glancing at Garg and then the others. Looking back down into the hole, she just waited, ready with her crossbow or her strange magic, should her aid be needed again. </div>

Then things got worse when the rock guardians appeared. He quickly took out his gun but then he saw Cheer fall like an idiot and he just couldn&#39;t hold back his laughter. &quot;Ha! Ha! Ha! At least you idiots... Ha!... can provide for decent... Ha! <strong>entertainment</strong>!&quot; So distracted was he that he didn&#39;t notice Hal looking at him and his attack was perhaps the worst one he had made since the whole thing started. One bullet hit the rock monster in a specially weakened point but it had so little power behind it that the damage was minimal, only making a few cracks on the thing... And the other was so badly aimed that it wasn&#39;t even fired down at the hole but towards the vault door. Good thing that his bullets were made of

In truth he was getting a little annoyed by this whole thing, too many setbacks from what was supposed to be a fast raid.

Without waiting for a response the captain continued on his way towards the secret docks, walking through the rubble and finally arriving at his destination.

Just like he suspected the thing was empty and there was a big rock blocking the way, so no matter if it was a small boat it wouldn&#39;t be able to enter the cave safely. </div>

“Swim or climb,” Hal mumbled, though from the look of things, she was certain she’d end up swimming one way or another.

He quickly moved to the bottom and looked up to see where he was going before using all his speed to dash forward and jump into the hole... He had been out of the sea so long that he has forgotten how fast he actually was so he ended overshooting... A lot.

Like a dumb pup he crashed into the rock wall. &quot;Fuck!&quot; He screamed, coughing both air and water before lady gravity did her thing and with a <strong>SPLASH</strong> he ended up in the water again just like Hal. </div>

He closed his eyes for a second but just then he heard another splash, probably from Cheer. <em>Well, there fucking goes another one.</em> He thought and just waited to Thrin to secure the rope, he would wait for the others to get up first so he would be sure that the rope would hold. </div>

The thing seemed to hold, so with a small growl of &quot;Fuck it...&quot; He started to climb. If he ended up falling again, he would just use his magic to teleport, guardians be damned.

In the end he reached the vault&#39;s entrance without an issue. &quot;Impressive Thrin...&quot; He simply growled and started to walk forward.

The cave twisted a couple of times but then opened into the big vault. The room seemed to have been emptied in a hurry, golden coins laying around all over the cave floor. Only a small opened chest was the only thing that has been left behind.... That and the ominous looking stoone on the back wall. </div>

Perhaps it was several things striking a nerve all at once? Unsure, and not wanting to upset him more, the girl just remained quiet, following the shark until they reached what most certainly had to be the vault. She noticed the strange stones, immediately having an idea of what they’d meant. One was definitely fire, the guardian they’d destroyed the night before. Another was water, the beast they’d encountered at their initial arrival. Still another was earth, those rocky creatures they’d defeated just moments ago. And then there was another, and it wasn’t difficult to guess that it represented the only element left—air. The state of the stones said it all. These creatures regenerated after their defeat. So they still had time, except... wind. 

“I am unsure if we should move quickly,” Hal said softly, her voice shaking ever so slightly. “I think a wind monster remains. Maybe we shouldn’t breathe too heavily or get too close to the stones?” she wondered aloud, hoping the others might also share their thoughts. In the meantime, she carefully bent over and scooped up whatever coins were nearby. </div>

He was also a fair captain so he grabbed only a quarter of it, 300gp to be exact. Also there were other items there. A pair of gloves, &quot;Trash...&quot; He growled picking them up and filling it with another quarter of gold before handing them to cheer. A pair of small boots, he didn&#39;t use shoes so he did the same, filling then with another 300gp of gold and gave them to Hal. There was also a small bag that appeared empty so he shrugged again and filled it with coins and gave it to Thrin.

It was clear that what the shark held captured her interest. “I love music,” she then admitted. “I sing and dance and play a few things. Pan pipe is my specialty,” she went on, before gasping and then wincing, having realized she was just babbling and probably making him irritated.

The girl bit down on her lip, mind whirling for a moment. She then dumped the coins into her pouch and put them away, her attention back on the boots she held. As her fingers moved over them, she suddenly realized what they were. And, more importantly, what they did. The red head then sat down, removing her current boots and stashing them away. She then pulled on the new ones, the shoes somehow fitting her without much of an issue. Standing up, the girl looked down at her feet and smiled. “I know what these are,” she said softly. “I’ve seen others wear them within my house back in the Feywild. These are boots of elvenkind, they aid in stealth.” Her smile grew, lips curving crookedly. “Thank you for these, Captain.” She made a soft sound, as she blushed, before taking a step or two to test the boots out. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="10-Jun-20 04:06 AM">(edited)</span></div>

It would certainly be nice sharing such a thing with anyone who appreciates the arts. Smiling, she just nodded and then took a few more steps in her new boots. 

“Yes, I’m ready to go,” Hal admitted, her smile remaining, as she watched Garg take to the sea. Her delicate hands took hold of her backpack straps and she turned to move back through the base. She knew the way now, so it wasn’t very long until she reached the docks, her blue eyes set on the ship that they’d helped to acquire. 

Walking towards the ship, Hal could see the other knights on board. No doubt they’d been preparing things all the while. Once on the ship, she looked to see if everyone had arrived yet or not. Waiting, she sighed softly, just eager to be ‘home’ so she could relax and recuperate. </div>

&quot;Alright! Time to leave this fucking place...&quot; He growled before unsheathing his cutlass and cutting off the moorings. Then once the ship was released he went to open the sails himself. It had been a long, long while since he had worked on a ship and he wanted to enjoy it, the small size of the long boat alse made things easier for only one person to do.

It was not a big ship, it would probably carry 20 to 30 people with some provisions in the small area without seats meant for the cargo and storing ropes. Just like the illusion Garg had showed them, the ship had an octopus in the dark sails and the wood was very dark, but besides the gloomy appearance it looked like a common longship made for short but fast voyages.

Despite the size and rocking motion of the ship, Garg moved like he was in the water, moving around everyone without even touching them and he looked more sure footed than he ever did on land.

Once everything was ready, Sails completely open, ropes properly secured and the captain at the helm... The wind did its job and the ships started to move, straight into the ocean.

&quot;I fucking missed this!!&quot; Screamed the pirate into the skies, his joy was very... <em>Visible.</em>

One thing Garg didn&#39;t notice or was ignoring, was that the farthest they got from land... They cloudy and windy it got. </div>

The girl smiled then, glad that they were finally on their way home, or well... what was ‘home’ now that her older one was lost. Biting down on her lip, she watched the captain make his way to the front of the ship. He seemed... happy. She was glad that at least something could set him into a light and positive place. It seemed similar to how she got whenever she had a moment to play her instruments or to sing or to dance. So it was definitely something she understood, if even for different things. “How long until we reach the Steel Heart, Captain?” she asked, hoping they’d all be back sooner than later. </div>

Garg just grinned even wider after hearing the questions, &quot;less than an hour! The shadow squid is one of the fastest ships in the sea!...

After all, a ship this small and fast required a strong hand to keep it steady, they all could see the strain that his muscular arm was taking with each wave that crashed against the hull.

Less than 300ft ahead, it appeared the the clouds hand descended and were making a small tornado that was growing arms. This was it, the last guardian and the last obstacle keeping them from their freedom.... And the crazy shark was taking the ship straight to it. </div>

Taking a deep breath, she turned to look at the cooks. “You recognize that thing?” she asked, recalling how both had mentioned needing to fight something off so the others could leave. Perhaps this was that beast. It would make sense. “Is it what tried to prevent the others from leaving?” The girl was certain she already knew the answer. But it didn’t hurt to make sure. “If it is, how did you manage before? Does it have weaknesses, strengths? Anything would be helpful.” Of course, she figured they’d probably speak in strange riddles or worse. But she had to try. It was how she was. While waiting for a response, she glanced at her crossbow. Somehow she didn’t think it would be all that effective in something made of wind and air. But... she had her elven magic. The shadow magic she’d been granted due to the special blood flowing through her veins. Once they got close enough, she knew what she’d do. She just hoped it would be enough to help them fight off this thing. </div>

Bracing herself, Hal then turned towards the knights. “Breathe under water? Perhaps if you have more you should share. Most of us cannot breathe anything but the air surrounding us.” The girl turned towards Tasty then. “Please, if able, share with us. It would be helpful should anything happen.”

&quot;What the fuck am I supposed to do with this?! We don&#39;t have time for <em>experiments,</em> man!&quot; They thrown the thing down angrily, and a bit panicked with the creature growing ever closer. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="13-Jun-20 12:10 AM">(edited)</span></div>

&quot;Oh yes! You belly can go boom! Hehe! And we have no bathroom!&quot; The Dwarf suddenly perked up after hearing the conversation, making wild gestures and giggling, indicating that the experience wouldn&#39;t be... <em>Pleasant</em>.

Meanwhile Garg kept swearing and talking about the wonders of the sea. &quot;...no fucker would mess with that but...... Ha! Without danger this would be so boring!.... And remember! Right now y&#39;all are part of my crew and no one scares the Boogeyman of the fucking Sea! They are the ones that should get fucking running!&quot;

In the distance, the elemental kept growling bigger and bigger, ready to smash the incoming ship. 150ft..
 100ft... 80ft... 60ft... Just when it looked like they were about to enter it&#39;s range and get smashed, Garg stabbed his shadowy Cutlass on the hull just in front of him and roared, &quot;This is where the fun truly starts!!&quot; He pulled the sword towards his body while keeping a quarter of the weapons embedded in the wood. Anyone familiar with flying vehicles would notice that he was using it as a control stick and just like anyone would expect from a flying contraption the whole ship tilted back and started to fly! It was strange because it still felt like it was sailing but the waves that crashed against the hull now looked like clouds instead of sea water. </div>

The giant fists made of condensed wind and water crashed against the sea, making a giant splash but whatever the crazy shark had done... It saved them from being smashed.

Despite now being in the air they weren&#39;t safe yet because the guardian raised his fist in the air while roaring, sounding like a storm... And just in front of their eyes a big storm manifested and they all found themselves inside the eye of a hurricane! Oviously their path was cut off and they were trapped!

&quot;Fuck!&quot; Garg roared and pulled the helm sideways, making the ship turn around and avoid the obviously dangerous wall of wind.

Now they were flying in circles and the elemental looked like it was regaining whatever strength it spent in summoning the hurricane. &quot;You fuckers do something!&quot; Garg screamed, all his focus was on steering the flying ship, both of his hands busy with the weird controls. </div>

But since she hadn’t been properly focused, the creature was easily able to handle the shadowy insult. Needing to better prepare herself, the girl then moved to hide behind the rim of the ship.

While he had both of his hands busy controlling the ship, basically preventing it to fall into the deadly vortex of wind keeping then trapped with the elemental... He still had his tail.

With a movement he thumped the floor of the ship, a small cannon made of shadows appeared at the ships bow and with a second thump it fired at the elemental. The cannon bullet impacted against the monster&#39;s body and pushed it 20ft away from the ship, almost making it collide against the wall of wind.

&quot;Ha! That&#39;s all you have you fucker?! No one best Captain Garg DreadStorm at the fucking Sea!&quot; He roared as a big octopus tentacle appeared from the water and tried to smash the elemental... But the hit went harmlessly through it. &quot;Fuck!&quot; </div>

The first attack crashed against the ship very hard. Besides damaging the ship only a few of the passengers were affected by it. Thrin fell hard on their ass but Garg and the human women took the brunt of the attack. The captain practically shook it off that is to his shadows but the woman was left bleeding gasping for air in the floor of the ship.

From what she could tell, that air elemental wasn’t going down quickly. And if it managed to seriously hit the ship... they’d all be swimming. As her eyes scanned the deck, she noticed the barrels Garg had mentioned. Immediately, she made her way towards one and began rolling it close to the edge, an idea forming in her mind. 

<em>”Once this barrel is set near the edge, blast it with wind towards the beast... Thrin can ignite it with their fire power once it’s inside the thing’s funnel,”</em> Hal prodded Garg’s mind. She glanced over her shoulder at the shark, hoping he was listening. As the girl rolled the barrel, she passed by Thrin. “Garg is going to propel the barrel towards the elemental once it is close enough. Could you send fire towards it once it is inside the beast? I think it might cause it to dissipate.” She looked at Thrin hopefully. “What do you say? For the guild? Besides, it’s our best shot at not dying.”

Hal then finished getting the barrel in place, her bright blue eyes looking at the pair and hoping they’d manage to work together here. </div>

The girl smiled when she saw it actually worked, halting the air elemental in its tracks and rendering it... gone. Relieved that they could finally go home, she stood up and leaned against the ship’s edge. “Glad we managed to pull that off. Wasn’t sure we would.” </div>

That was amazing shadow girl! And y&#39;all finally worked like the crew I thought you were at the beginning!&quot; He was very... Happy. For once the angry shark looked to be enjoying life, not even a little anger seen on him.

Thanks to the boost from the explosion and the wind magic only around 10 minutes passed before finally arriving at the steel hearts and instead of docking at the hanger like anyone should... Garg just landed the ship on the top deck sinse the shadow squid was very, very little compared to the massive steel hearts.
&quot;Here we are!&quot; He cheered and jumped onto the main deck before starting to make his way inside. &quot;I need a fuckin drink! Ha!&quot; And with that the sharkin went away, completely forgetting to set up the classes with Hal or to inform the kinghts about their new home. </div>
