                <div class="chatlog__content">
                    <div class="markdown">It had been a long day and evening was starting to roll its way in over the mountain town of Pioneer. Twinkling stars dotted the inky sky, streaked with marks of soft orange and purple. Rose had met with the guild master, Cassius Clay, and been given a room of her very own aboard the airship. It was still a little unsettling, though in the nicest of ways, to have her own space and be somewhere seemingly safe. Though she had to question... was it really? Still, it was a far better place than that sinking ship and the icy cold waters it had traversed. 

After finding her little place of privacy, and also taking a moment to change and wash her face, the winter eladrin decided to take the guild master’s advice and seek out the one and only Edgar Clay. The skeleton man had briefed Rose about the man, one of the few Clay’s to actually still be flesh and blood. Alive. The girl had to wonder... was this family cursed? Or did they dabble in the darker Magic’s of necromancy? No matter. They were helping her and, for now, trying their best to give her a home. 

Home? It wasn’t a word Rose would use lightly. Home wasn’t a town or village. Nor was it a humble bedroom of one’s own. It was the people who surrounded you, cared for you. The people you could rely on. She hadn’t known such a thing save her brief time under the tutelage of Horace. But... her heart twisted, those dark memories of her mentor dismembered and bloodied, those poachers looking upon her with a hunger unlike anything she’d ever seen or known. 

Suddenly, Rose found herself in the pens, her tiny body nearly bumping into the door. In her slight arms, she protectively carries Amelia’s egg—a Kenku egg. Licking her lips and then pushing her wild white hair out of her pale face, she finally raised her hand and gently knocked upon the door. “H-hello?” she said, her voice hesitant and unsure. “Edgar? I... I was told to look for you here,” she went on. “I... I’ve an egg. A Kenku egg. Hello?” </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Rose jumped slightly at the sudden sound of a bird. The eladrin eyed it curiously, as she’d never seen a bird that could actually talk before. Of course, she’d heard of the more exotic Kenkus and Aarakocras. But... they were bipedal creatures of similar sentience, so it didn’t feel quite the same, as what she was both seeing and hearing right then. Though, truth be told, the girl had never met or even seen one of those kinds either. In that moment, she suddenly felt so small and insignificant. So closed off from what the world had to offer. 

“Oh, hello,” Rose began. “It’s nice to meet you. I’m Rosewynn Elaris. Though please, call me Rose. Like the flower.” The eladrin winced realizing how ludicrous that must seem. A flower growing in the winter snows just wasn’t a sight to behold. It... it didn’t exist. It couldn’t. “I don’t expect you to remember that,” she went on, her gaze shifting to the egg in her arms. The girl then held it out for Edgar to better inspect. 

“And it’s all right,” Rose continued. “I’ve never seen a bird like your Goldie before. In fact, I’ve not seen much of anything save snow and mountains.” The girl blushed, her pale skin turning a light shade of pink. “This?” she then said, her pale eyes flitting to the egg she carried. “No. This isn’t mine, though I suppose it is now. It had belonged to a little girl named Amelia. It belongs to a friend of hers and is its baby. It’s Kenku.” She paused, biting down on her lower lip. “You may look, if you like,” she added, holding out the egg for Edgar. “The guild master advised I come find you.” </div>

Maybe he was a visual learner.

&quot;Goldie is a Golden Maccaw.  Bit more at home in the Jungles to the South.&quot;  She revealed she hasnt been far from home.  He snickered.  &quot;Dont worry.  Thats going to change.&quot;  

He was inspecting the egg and listening to her at the same time.  &quot;Yep, Grandpa would.  I take care of animals, doesnt mean I dont know how to take care of people though.  Theres alot of overlap.&quot;

&quot;Heck of a story.  Seems like this little guy traveled far too.&quot;  He gently patted the top of the egg.  He opened the door, being wary of more escape attempts.  &quot;Come on in.&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">There were white roses? The very idea of such a thing was new to Rose and she had to admit she rather liked knowing it. She wondered how many others in the world knew of this interesting fact. Pushing that thought aside, she realized her face had grown warm. She was certain is was from the warmth of ship. The eladrin hadn’t been anywhere truly warm... ever.

Clearing her throat, Rose nodded. She could hear and even smell the presence of more animals nearby. She couldn’t help but wonder just what this airship held! It was a definite ark, an animal sanctuary. “Well Goldie is lovely,” she said, not really thinking about what she was saying. She was enthralled by this new exotic beast she was seeing. And hearing. “I can talk to them too,” she went on. “My mentor, Horace...” Suddenly, the girl’s voice trailed and those horrific memories flooded back. She could see her mentor’s bloodied body, those poacher’s faces. She remembered the day Horace found her stuck in one of their bear traps—the mangled scar remained.

“S-sorry,” Rose apologized, realizing she’d gone quiet. Her pale eyes were glistening, stinging from tears she refused to let fall. The girl took a deep breath and steadied herself. “Just was remembering something,” she tried to recover. “I can get distracted sometimes.” She winced then. It was a terrible lie. But she didn’t want to burden anyone further. It had been hard enough telling the guild master. 

“Anyway,” Rose continued, stepping inside, after watching Edgar test the egg in her arms a bit more. “Oh... my...” The eladrin’s words were cut short. She was stunned by all the creatures she saw... and all in one place! “These all yours?” she whispered, breathless. Carefully, she set down the egg on what seemed to be a pile of warm blankets. It would do for now. “Do you have polar bears?” she then asked, the particular animal one that was dearest to her heart, the one that her mentor had always seemed to favor. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="08-Nov-19 11:51 PM">(edited)</span></div>

Edgar looked over, walking beside her.  He heard her, piping in.  &quot;Speak with Animals&#39; Spell?&quot;  He said to here.  &quot;Yeah.  I had to study my butt off to get that as well but-&quot;  he was about to go into his own little thoughts when she noticed that she was ill at ease.  &quot;Is it the smell, I&#39;m sorry-&quot;

She apologized and he wasn&#39;t going to pry.  He had enough insight to know it had something bad to do with that Horace she mentioned.  &quot;Sounds bad.  My sympathies.&quot; He began.  &quot;If it ever gets bad, come back to me.  Petting something fluffy and warm is therapeutic.&quot;

Suddenly Rose feels something on her ankle, a fluffy little &#39;cat&#39; purr as it rubs itself against her. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">“Oh... uhh... yes...” Rose answered in regards to the very spell Edgar had mentioned, her skin going quite pink. It indeed had been one Horace had taken the time to teach her, telling her it was important to listen to all creatures of the world. So many times the two had spoken with the animals of the mountains—bears, foxes, wolves. She even learned to shift into a wolf and hoped to one day shift into the same sort of bear, as Horace once did. But... she’d need a mentor for that sort of help. 

“Oh no no...” Rose then said quickly, raising up her hands in protest. “I don’t even notice a smell,” she went on, nodding, trying to reassure. The girls wild white hair just bounced everywhere, her curls going this way and that. “I... yes and thank you,” she finally managed. She’d done a terrible job of ensuring this man wasn’t bothered by her past. Apparently, she was wearing her thoughts and emotions on her sleeve. Oh bloody hell! How was she to make friends if all they saw was this? The eladrin frowned, but it soon turned into a smile when she looked down and saw the cat nuzzling her leg. She could easily lose herself in a place like this. Lose herself and find... peace. 

“Really?” Rose then squeaked, eager to see something from the lands she knew, the animal dearest to Horace. The girl turned her head to follow where Edgar was gesturing. She soon followed him, her steps light and airy. Suddenly, her pale eyes were met with a sight that took her breath away instantly. “Oh... oh...” she stammered, a smile trying to spread across her face. She took a few steps closer, gazing at the mother and her cubs and she felt her eyes begin to sting. “Th-thank you...” she whispered, her heart racing, while thoughts of Horace hit her hard. “I... I needed this...” She turned toward Edgar and smiled. “They were my mentor’s favorite,” she divulged before wiping the tears away, a smile finally finding her lips. </div>

And he was there to bask in the glow of picking up a new friend&#39;s spirits.  &quot;I understand.&quot;  He approached and put a hand on the stable door.  &quot;When the cubs are big enough, Ill introduce you.&quot;  Last thing he wanted to do was deal with an angry mother.  &quot;Horace had good tastes.  They are majestic creatures.  Please, visit them anytime you like.&quot; He understood any little bits of comfort would be valuable.

&quot;But- speaking of mother...&quot;  Edgar said noticing finally the egg in her hands.  &quot;You might be called one yourself pretty soon.&quot;  He snickered but he nodded.  &quot;That egg in your hands, it will hatch soon.&quot;  He managed to get a couple a peeks, and the size was about what was needed.  &quot;Good news, Kenku are amazingly self reliant.  Most of the time, they just copy what the mother does until they figure it out.&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">“I would like that,” Rose said, her pale eyes fixed on the polar bears. “So would Horace.” Her eyes were welling up again, so she wiped at them with the back of her sleeve. Still watching the bears, she added, “Yes, Horace had wonderful taste and understood both animals and people better than anyone.” She knew it was why he’d opted for seclusion. The man had been disheartened by most people whether human or elf or other. He’d preferred the company of animals. She had been his one exception and she’d known it. 

While reminiscing on lighter memories for once, Rose suddenly turned towards Edgar. “A... a mother?” The eladrin immediately blushed. She knew nothing of motherhood and a wave of embarrassment washed over her. She was very inexperienced, not so much as having kissed a man. Just then, she looked at the egg and she realized what the man had meant. “Oh... uhh... the Kenku...” she muttered awkwardly, nodding a little. Her face darkened even more, though she felt a sudden relief that he’d been indicating the egg and not her own state of health. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">“That’s good that they are like that,” Rose stated, slowly getting more comfortable. “I’ve never met any Kenku before. This will be a first for me.” The girl tilted her head, wild white curls bouncing to the side. “When do you expect it to hatch? Will it remain on board the ship or will we eventually search for it’s true mother?” she asked. “I think the little girl who cared for this egg knew it’s mother. Perhaps her parents might as well. I don’t know. Though they hadn’t seemed too interested in it earlier. So it’s hard to say.” She bit down on her lower lip then, her heart feeling badly that this baby Kenku might never get to know its mother or its mother’s friend. Then again... not all parents were kind and warm, the sorts wanting the best for their child. Her own hadn’t had any issues turning her away, throwing her into the snapping jaws of harm. Closing her eyes a moment, she decided she couldn’t think about that. She’d just allow herself a small indulgence and hope for a warm reunion of Kenkus at some point in the future instead. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">He began to move deeper into his stables, coming to a little outcropping between the pens a little spot where he seemed to work.  Though most of it was just a kitchen with all manner of containers with different mixes of food, and what looked like table set up with brushes, clippers, scissors, a grooming table maybe.  Edgar spoke as he began to move around, grabbing towels, a dish, and began to mix contents from other bins and containers.  &quot;Kenku are- well, they copy everything.  Actions, words, voices.  Don&#39;t be afraid if it sounds like you for a while.  Its kind of creepy.&quot;

He turned on a lamp and let the towels out on the table, &quot;Put it here.&quot;  he suggested, giving the two of them room to observe.  The light even seemed to help show the shadow inside of the egg.  Edgar then responded to how she came about it.  &quot;I&#39;m sure she had her reasons...&quot;  He began but it was obvious that there was a little bit he wasn&#39;t exactly thrilled to share.  Kenku did have a reputation.

&quot;Alright, so, should be any day now.&quot;  He put his hand on it.  &quot;It&#39;s kicking.  You felt it?&quot;  Edgar asked, his hand holding one side.  &quot;After that, just keep it warm.  Feed it warm, meat-&quot;  He shrugged.  &quot;You know what.  I&#39;ll mix it.  If that happens, try to bring it down to me.  Got to make sure the little guy is alright.&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Rose listened intently, as Edgar explained a few things about the Kenku. The eladrin furrowed her brow, a bit saddened though she wasn’t sure why. She had no ties to this egg save Amelia and... the girl sighed softly. Oh, she knew exactly why she couldn’t and wouldn’t abandon it. Though Amelia and her actions had played a part, the majority of her reasons were because she understood full well what it was like to be abandoned. Cast out like garbage... worthless, meaningless trash. She couldn’t let another suffer those same terrible feelings. No. It would know love and care and kindness. It would know it had a home, a place. 

“Copy? Really?” Rose asked aloud. “Like Goldie?” She wondered if it merely mimicked or actually communicated. Could it ever choose its own words or actions? “Will it ever make the choice to use its own words?” Just then, the girl paused, a bit embarrassed that she’d suddenly become a font of question after question. No doubt this would annoy the beast master. Surely he had more important things to tend to than her barrage of questions about Kenku. 

Wincing slightly, Rose looked down at the floor. But she followed Edgar’s lead and carefully set the egg down on the provided blankets. As she set it down, she felt it move, almost like something inside the shell was trying to make its presence known. And perhaps it was. She bit down on her lower lip, awkwardly stepping back to look at the whole egg. “Y-yes. I felt it,” she admitted. “Though not sure if it’s lucky to be in my care or not.” Her cheeks went red at Edgar’s compliments, never having gotten any before. Even Horace rarely gave her praises, the old man having other ways in which he’d showed his appreciation of her company and friendship. “But I’ll do my best.” She leaned close to the egg once more, inspecting the shell for signs of hatching. </div>

It was daunting and exciting, a flurry of emotions Rose couldn’t help but feel, as she looked upon the egg. “Hope you won’t mind an eladrin bothering you with questions once it hatches...” she prodded, hoping it would be all right and not bothersome. “I... I might have many...” she muttered, raking a hand through her wild white hair. “Heh, I know I will.” </div>

They had a baby to consider and while Edgar could- Kenku weren&#39;t animals.  The pens was no where for a baby check.  He put his hands toget to begin.

&quot;Kenku copy.  And I mean, perfectly.  It&#39;s weird.  Theres some kind of weird curse on the entire race.  They can perfectly copy any sound they hear, copy any action, any writing.  Thats at a cost that they don&#39;t get their own original ideas.  They&#39;re only as smart as how much they&#39;re exposed to.  They can take care of themselves, but to thrive, they need alot of-&quot;

                    <div class="markdown">Once again, Rose bit down on her lower lip, her face feeling extremely warm. She looked away from Edgar then, her pale eyes focusing on the egg she’d set down per his suggestion. She listened to him, however, nodding as things began to sink in. These Kenku sounded rather tragic. It was something she could get and was definitely something she could feel sympathy for. 

At that, Rose pursed her lips together, determined that this Kenku would be the smartest yet. She’d make sure it could read... could they even? If they could copy... was such a thing even possible? It was hard to know, but she’d certainly try at the very least. In a way, she decided it was good this egg made it aboard the airship. It was filled with so many colorful sorts—different races, all with very unique abilities. It would be the best sort of exposure to make sure this particular creature became the smartest of its kind. 

Slowly becoming lost in thought, Rose’s pale eyes slid back over to Edgar. The moment their eyes locked, his words registered and her face grew hot again. She reached up to touch her cheeks, her fingers quite cool against her skin. He actually enjoyed her company? She hadn’t expected that, but it was a pleasant realization to say the least. Giggling softly, nervously, her eyes found the floor again. “Right... a friend,” she repeated. But the awkward moment was interrupted, as the egg began to make sounds. 

Immediately, Rose looked at the egg and gasped, a lopsided grin on her face. “Is it... is it hatching, Edgar?” She looked at the beast master with wide and hopeful eyes. “Is it going to be born?” She couldn’t help but giggle again, her nervousness turning into giddy elation. </div>

He looked at it, felt its side, then it <strong>TCK</strong> and rumbled.  &quot;Oh my gods, wow what good timing!&quot;  He took Rose by her hand, and by her shoulder.  &quot;You stand here.&quot;  he said, making sure she was right in front of the egg.

                    <div class="markdown">Edgar’s grip was firm, as he positioned her in front of the egg. Rose could still feel the heat from his palms once he let go and became a flurry of action within his grand menagerie. She watched him gather up items, she was certain would assist in the hatching. And that egg... it wasn’t waiting for anything or anyone. 

Rose swallowed hard, her pale eyes moving to the egg, as it moved and jolted. The cracks got bigger and it wasn’t long before she saw the tiny creature poking through, ready for the world. “Oh... oh my goodness...” she whispered, utterly enthralled. This wasn’t just some animal. But a sentient being. She was sure of that even if the Kenku imitated and copied. She had to believe there was a mind longing to break free and express. 

Suddenly, the baby Kenku was free from the confines of its shell and making its way towards the first person it saw. Her. Rose. Again, Rose swallowed, a lump in her throat, as an onslaught of thoughts filled her head. This was a huge responsibility. Could she do it? Was this what was best for this creature? Gasping softly, she took a step towards the little thing, she brought her hands up and reached back to it, letting it know it was safe while she was there. 

“Hello, little Kenku,” Rose said, unsure and nervous. She then pointed to herself with her free hand. “I’m Rose. Eladrin.” She bit down on her lower lip, her eyes searching for Edgar. He was familiar with these beings. Was she doing this right? She didn’t know and she needed the reassurance that she was. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">The little thing tried to open its mouth.  The sound.... it was a whistle.  It was a whistle but it was the same inflections of her words.  It spread its little arms and little claws and walked towards her.  It went immediately for her hand, putting claws on it, little tiny hands.

Edgar did appear.  &quot;Oh my gods...&quot;  He set the blankets and towels aside and leaned in over the little child.  The Kenku looked at him, then back to her, meanwhile he put his hand on his cheeks and made little cutesy baby talk.  &quot;Arent you the cutest wittle chicky girl yes you are-&quot;  He then explained himself when he saw her, a little flash of red in his cheeks.  &quot;Its a girl, you can tell, the eyes slaint a little, just so.  And she has less pronounced head feathers.&quot;

The baby put its claws on its cheeks and seemed to lean over and made little &#39;peep peep peeep and whistles as it seemed to follow him, though it fell then.  It climbed onto its hands and knees, looking over at Rose.  Its big eyes began to water.  

Edgar helped, passing her a cloth.  &quot;Here, start cradling her.&quot;  He showed her how to do it, just like a human or elf baby.  &quot;How her like this.  Right in the crook of your arm.&quot;  he instructed, his eyes wide, happy. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="20-Nov-19 12:30 AM">(edited)</span></div>

                    <div class="markdown">So, it was a girl. A little baby Kenku girl. Rose nodded and smiled, a hand moving to push away her wild, white curls. “Is she trying to copy me?” she asked of Edgar, her own pale eyes going wide. The eladrin turned to look at the man. For someone who’d probably seen something like this several times over, he seemed utterly enthralled. Perhaps she would too should something like this ever happen again in her life. Though with how alone she still felt, she wasn’t so sure it would. Suddenly, a pang of emotion caused her chest to tighten. 

Trying to stay calm and not waste the moment, Rose shoved her feelings aside, making room for the awe and wonder she was experiencing right there and then. “Rose,” she said again, pointing to herself. She then pointed to Edgar. “Edgar.” The girl smiled and then did as instructed. She picked up the little Kenku and placed her in her arms. Somehow, without having to be taught, she began rocking the baby. It did fit rather easily in her arms. As she cradled the tiny creature, she couldn’t help but wonder how she knew to do that. Was it instinct? She didn’t know. Still, she needed the reassurance, to know someone both cared and approved. “Like this?” she then asked. “Am I doing it right?”

Rose just held the Kenku and rocked her arms. It was so small and new. And she knew next to nothing about these creatures. “So, it’s a girl. What shall we name her then?” she asked aloud. “She will certainly need one. So lets give her a good one.” The eladrin smiled then. Yes. This little Kenku would be the smartest of its kind. And though all it could do was copy, she’d make sure it would always be understood. Somehow. Because despite the mimicry, she just knew there would be a voice inside yearning to be heard and to share. </div>

Its movements were of course, that of a new born, it was quite amazing she knew how to stand on her little legs right out of the egg.  Maybe an evolutionary trait.

&quot;<em>Peep.</em>&quot;  &quot;<em>eee-eep</em>&quot;  getting the syllables right atleast.  

The kenku took to her quite handily.  Nestling as deep as it could into her arm, its little body rising and falling.  

Edgar was all encouragments.  &quot;Yeah.  Just like that.  Mothers will usually surround chicks in as much as they can.  Her feathers arent fully grown so she gets cold easily.  Yeah.  Wow youre good at this.&quot;  He said.

&quot;Yeah she does.&quot;  He thought a moment.  &quot;Hmm... Rose.&quot;  He thought a moment.  &quot;I know this is super original.  But.  Lavender?  Violet?  Lily?&quot;  He was going with the dark flowers theme.  &quot;Lotus? Orchid?&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Rose continued to cradle the baby Kenku, her pale eyes watching it attempt to imitate her. The eladrin just knew she’d get it sooner than later and be the smartest Kenku yet! She blushed at Edgar’s compliments, never really having thought about ever being a mother. She’d been around far too few to have it ever be a serious thought. But now? Now it was thrust upon her and despite all the fears and apprehensions... she was willing and ready to embrace the experience. 

The little Kenku continued to nuzzle close to Rose, constantly trying to repeat her words, her sounds. It was astonishing how well she did despite being newly hatched. Suddenly, the eladrin paused, her head perking up the moment Edgar said ‘Lily’. For some reason it struck home. She was a rose in winter, while this Kenku was a lily amidst the darkness. Somehow, it just seemed to fit. “Lily...” the girl repeated. She then looked to the Kenku in her arms. Fist she pointed to herself. “Rose.” Then to Edgar. “Edgar.” Finally she pointed the Kenku. “Lily.” 

Rose then looked over at Edgar, her face so very hot. “Lily is perfect. The perfect name for her.” She gave the beast master a pretty, albeit crooked, smile before returning her attention back to the newborn. “Where shall we keep her then?” she asked of Edgar. “She’ll need a space and supplies. So many things.” </div>

                    <div class="markdown">&quot;Re-Re.&quot;  Lily peeped.  Trying, and almost in reflection to Rose&#39;s face, it tried to smile.  It was just the tiniest little expression but it looked up at her with eyes.  Never would someone trust another so quickly.  But its smile then faded to a cascade of peeps.  Little chirps as she swung her arms.

&quot;It is perfect.&quot;  Edgar was blushing a little bit too.  It was an emotional scene and he was excited for her, happy that she was accepting it, and happy for little Lily too.  He was scratching the back of his head.  &quot;Well, I mean.  I guess, anywhere.  Your room, here, but uhh, last thing I want is her wandering into one of the pens not til she knows she shouldn&#39;t.&quot;  He then snapped his fingers.  &quot;How settled are you in your room in the quarters?  The Hanger has a little storage room thats actually bigger then the deck rooms.  I can move the stuff out of it, set up a little nursery for her.&quot;  It was going to be alot of work, but as long as he had the help, he seemed thrilled to do so.

But then he heard the peeping.  &quot;Upp, get used to that.&quot;  He went for a can nearby and with a pair of tweasers he offered it to her while holding out the can, ironically it was catfood.  &quot;Vital proteins and nutrients.&quot; </div>

Biting down on her lip, she nodded. “Well, I have moved in and it’s been decorated nicely,” she said. “Far nicer than I’d expected really, though I hardly mind.” She laughed nervously then, cheeks still tinted pink. “Will the hangar be too far away? Or should I only bring her there when I need to take jobs?” So many questions. 

Smiling at Lily, Rose pet the Kenku’s little head and nodded. She was slowly starting to understand it, even if she couldn’t speak yet. It gave her some comfort knowing that the newborn had the chance of being well understood despite the known limitations. She turned to Edgar, the man smile king brightly. He seemed quite excited about what the moment they’d shared regarding Lily’s arrival into the world. Just then, he brought out something that seemed to resemble food. Little Lily grabbed for it, her hunger clear. “What is that?” Rose then asked of Edgar. “Is that what I should feed her? Does one need to change a baby Kenku or are they capable? What foods do they like? How often should she eat? What’s the sleeping like?” Once more, the eladrin was a font of questions. She just hoped she did well by this newborn that had suddenly entered her life. </div>

She explains and he raises his hand to his chin, trying to figure something out.  &quot;Hmm...  It might get a little crowded eventually, but it might be best if she stay with you.&quot;  he nods a little bit.  &quot;Once she&#39;s a foot or so in a few months, we can look at it again.  She&#39;d need to be with you constantly if she&#39;s going to learn quick.  MMMmm... maybe we can make a nest out of a satchel.  Think of it like a baby stroller, but you know, less intrusive.&quot;

He began to answer her questions.  &quot;Yeah for three to four weeks.  Once you show her what to do, she should be able to figure it out.  These things are regular sponges.  Soft meats first, rice, boiled vegetables.  Lots of water.  Everytime she peeps, and that could be like five times a day.

                    <div class="markdown">Rose merely nodded, taking in everything she was told. She’d make it a point to visit the library at some point and find a book about Kenkus. It wouldn’t hurt to do some extra reading and find out all the information she could. “I see, all right,” she said in response. “Though I’ll need to possibly drop her off here should a job arise. So, if you don’t mind watching her should such a thing arise, I’d appreciate it,” she added. Truth be told, she didn’t really know anyone else. Yes, there was Alex, but he’d seemed so rattled from the Ice Breaker that she didn’t want to bother him. And Garg? Oh no... most certainly not! The shark didn’t even know how to handle a grown up, let alone a child. That just left Edgar. So she hoped he wouldn’t mind. 

As she listened to the beast master explain more and more, she set to work on prepping a special satchel for Lily. It would have everything the little Kenku needed, at least for now until she had to get her more food. Suddenly, Lily fell fast asleep, surprisingly the eladrin at how quickly it did. With an arched brow, she carefully placed the Kenku into her satchel and slung it over her body. 

“I suppose a list or something would be helpful, yes,” Rose said with a nod, her own body exhausted from her ordeal. The aches of her muscles were getting to her, her own body needing precious rest, as much as Lily’s. “I think I need some rest,” she admitted sheepishly, trying to stifle a sudden yawn. “Probably should get some sleep before Lily next wakes and maybe pick up some food along the way so that I have some on hand.” </div>

At that, she gave Edgar an appreciative nod and headed back towards the door. “I’ll see you soon,” she said. “I know I’ll have more questions as I go.” The girl would then him an awkward hug, careful not to disturb Lily, and make her exit. Every step she’d take towards <span class="mention">#rosewynns-room</span>, she would feel her eyes growing heavier, her body desperate for rest, so that she could finally heal up from her time on the Ice Breaker. </div>

He smiled at her when she laid an arm on him.  He would have done something, but his hands were full at the time.  But the look was enough to encourage him.  It was worth it, but you&#39;d do alot of things to see a smile like that, even if it was nervous.

&quot;Like I said,  Doors always open.  And- wouldn&#39;t mind seeing you in the mess hall from time to time.&quot;  He said as he leaned on the door frame.  She gave him a hug, he squeezed her back.  &quot;Dont be a stranger.&quot;  And she was off, him watching her go.

&quot;You know, maybe I should get out there...&quot;  The pen door closed.

&quot;Hmph...you see this new form and immediately think I would do something so low. That is where we are very different, dear Kalas...I see this youth and I see potential for more power and knowledge. I feel this pure energy within me, and I think only of how much more I can do now. And Margot? The Raven Father is not so...kind towards mere mortals like us. You are lucky if he is even willing to address you. You are better off asking me as I attempt to view his knowledge.&quot; </div>
