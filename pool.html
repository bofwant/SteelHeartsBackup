                    <div class="markdown">The captain Garg DreadStorm was not the same as before... Now he had abandoned the sharkin&#39;s only weakness. Now he had complete control over his body. Now his adrenaline was running on a constant level around his body, no more burst of frenzies for him. Now he was fully in control of his body. Now he had a dark void instead of a heart.

He walked into the pool, looking for the biggest body of water to make into his new resting place. He refused to return to the baths, it was disgusting anyway, everyone mated there without a care in the world... He knew the appeal now, after all he had done it on the mess hall himself... But now he was free from that weakness...

As he walked he noticed two guildmembers, one of them was the strange bird that his boss had used to mess with him the other day... And the other one was that wimp that had disrespected him, he sniffed the air and grimaced. Of course. &quot;So in the end you got what you wanted... Dissapointing, she was a weak one then...&quot; He said loud enough so Pox and Faust could hear him while he stood on the edge of the pool while looking at them. </div>

“Minty?”&#160; She repeated in his words.&#160; She brought the bottle back.&#160; “Pox tries mixing things together.&#160; Pox keeps notes, knows formula. Try to find the one that gives Pox their wings back.”&#160; She goes into her cloak and he can see all the little brick a brack on her person, the mortar and pistol, the leather bags, the hollowed out crystals, and the reinforced glass vessels and vials that resist breaking allowing the canisters of others made of real glass.&#160; “Pox needs its medicine. Otherwise Pox go loopy. Better when mixed with drink. Go to bar very often yep.”

Pox nearly jumped.&#160; Her four whatever and baggy clothing and cloak standing straight up, making her look like a little dark square on the far end of the pool.&#160; Her head twisted this way and that. “Hrraw? Shark. Bath has shark.” She remembered him in it. What was his- “Garg.” She heard someone say.&#160; “Hihi Garg. This your room?” She asked not exactly scared, but more curious. “Weak one? Garg talk to Pox?”

Something in her reaching out with whipping appendages. </div>

Good at herbs too.&quot;  She nods.  &quot;Pox happy friend want help.&quot;

Pox laughed.  &quot;Pox very strange.&quot;  She concurred.  &quot;Chirp?&quot;  She said when asked if she was aware before casting a glance.  &quot;No, Pox didn&#39;t know.  Buuuut Not worried.  No one want to make Egg with Pox.  Last who tried died.&quot;  She left it cryptic.  Pox listened in and her eyes narrowed.  &quot;Bad blood.&quot;  She said, sensing hostility.  The Kenku craned her head upward after Garg showed her displeasure.  

Pox saw the bad blood and made sure to get in between the both of them, her talons up.  &quot;No fight please.&quot;  She asks.  &quot;Faust.  Captain Garg.&quot;  She spoke in their own words, parroted from them.

Pox looked to the water, tendrils rising up.  The bird chirped as she noticed the tentacles in the pool... her eyes began to glow a venomous green... There was something moving out of her beak, like little tiny worms wriggling through and falling onto the tiles.  She moved closer to the pool.  

Inside her, there was a battle going on.  It was similar but there was nothing like it...  and it wanted to seduce and slay the power that was making an appearance. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Garg just good there with his arms crossed, he could hear Faust or Pox words because his head was filled with his Boss whispers, *&quot;Aww you actually found another one for me little shark... Well let me give you a little present, you assume that I&#39;m a male, but actually I&#39;m a female and yes that was my baby so what? He&#39;s not being harmed by those syrens they are just my babysitters...&quot; They were very loud in his head, but not actually hurting him. He just wanted this to be over so he could go and eat some raw meat... And maybe find the rest of his crew, he still needed some officials.

From the water a beautiful woman? Appeared between the squirming tentacles, &quot;Oh! What a lovely day to meet a new employee... By the way don&#39;t worry about your heart boy, I have it in a safe place... I won&#39;t let my most promising minion die that easily...&quot; She said as she looked around the pool, &quot;What a lovely place... I&#39;m gonna visit you more often, it&#39;s so tiring to keep talking to you by &#39;phone&#39;&quot; and by phone she meant talk to him through puddles of water.

Finally she noticed Pox and Faust, &quot;I don&#39;t know who you are but be a pretty little pet and keep quiet... Maybe I&#39;ll have some fun with you, I did hear my new recruit to call you a liar, they make the most wonderful pets...&quot; &#39;She&#39; said to Faust and the turned towards the wriggling bird, &quot;Oh my! You look lovely, so much squirming!&quot; The kraken said and used one of &#39;her&#39; big tentacles to poke Pox a little... Meanwhile Garg just scowled, finally his head was not ringing and he noticed what was happening but preferred to keep silent and observe. </div>

The woman, the creature, Garg’s boss... it was hard to know why it enjoyed that form when speaking, maybe to throw people off. Lure them in like that god she was.
But the thing in this room was not a supplicant.&#160; Pox was gone, and only this writhing thing remained.&#160; A dozen dozen voices spoke at once when Pox deigned to speak.

The aberrant woman just smiled and kept poking the other mass of tentacles, &quot;Oh my! How lovely...&quot; She said with a little glint in her eyes, like this was what she was expecting. &quot;Very good indeed... Now, I&#39;m sure that introductions are not necessary since you seem to know who I am and I&#39;m not really interested in listening to your sob story of why you need a vessel, and is very rude to comment on a ladies age you know? But I&#39;ll let it slide since you called me a pretty maid.&quot; She said touching her rosy checks a little, like she was <s>faking to be</s> embarrassed.

&quot;I am here to offer you a deal, I lend you my powers like I did to little sharko over there...&quot; She patted the growling Garg ont he head with a big tentacle, like he was a puppy or something, &quot;... And you keep to your quest to kill those fools that call themselves Gods. You will need a training period of course, just to get the hang of things...&quot; Then she closed her eyes and sighed in a dreamy way, &quot;I still remember when Gargy was a little intern, following Draq, other of my generals, around like a lost puppy while he was shown the tentacles of the business...&quot; She started to ramble about Garg&#39;s training period, but the offer was already on the table. Get power in exchange of continuing her crusade, just a little investment from the elder aberration would be the more accurate way to explain the nature of this deal in a few words. </div>

It said in is cacophony of vocal sludge.  The krakens words seemed to honestly not effect that thing or things that constantly whirled in and out of its flesh.

Pox shoke and shaked a little bit before its writhing head looked in his direction, worms falling from it.  It was unknown if it was intentional... but it just seemed to happen when it moved.

She tried to slink backward... a terrible hacking sound is heard as if a bird was throwing up, before the creature fell onto its back, its numerous limbs convulsing and shaking.   It fell backwards and slowly its kenku body began to wretch and form out of the mass.  Talons and lings reaching, twitching as pieces of her sloughed off into a disgusting mass of black.  She was coughing the whole time... </div>

He smiled in a cruel way, this was good, perfect even. No more rash decisions, no more impulso sharkin. Now... He was in control.

He decided that it was useless after all, why did he needed a place to rest comfortably of he was totally in control of his body now. &quot;I must thank you strange bird, you have make me realize something very important...

Ford is just a couple strokes behind, but he soon catches up.  By around the halfway point of the pool, it looks like they&#39;re going to be neck and neck.  It&#39;s very close, but at the end, Ford&#39;s hand touches the opposite edge right before the girl does, making him the winner!

The girl looks like she&#39;s about to release steam through her ears with how red her face gets.  Her little fists ball up in front of her, and she grasps Ford by the shoulders with surprising strength.</em>

“These next few minutes might hurt if you don’t stop me.” Morag said, clenching her left fist to start punching.”

<em>Rivaan hits the floor hard as Morag lands on top of him almost knocking the wind out of him. He watches as she raises her fist to strike and listens intensely to her words. The edges of his mouth curl up in a mischievous smile as smoke begins to billow out. A faint glow of orange and red form at the back of his throat. It grows brighter and hotter as the Dragonborn opens his mouth wider. Locking eyes with the wolf girl, he unleashes his fire breath hoping to break free of her grasp.</em>

Entering the pool area, he dismissed his clothes made of shadows, leaving himself only wearing his shorts. He had an almost empty botte in one hand that he raised to his lips to finish at once.

He threw the now empty thing away, not caring where it landed and made a mess, then he just jumped into the water. Despite being drunk he made a perfect dive, the water practically remained undisturbed. Just like any sharkin he could sleep in two different ways. Like a common humanoid where he remained still or like a shark, the one he truly enjoyed, where he kept swimming in a slow aimless way, parts of his brain resting while the others kept his body moving and the water flowing through his gills. </div>

He noticed then the electric field made by living flesh in the water. While he was not ruled by his instincts like before he still had all his shark senses intact so he became curious of who this was. They had a strong pulse he noticed.

Little by little he moved closer to where Faith was, making some zigzags. From the outside of the water would look like a shark stalking it&#39;s prey. </div>

He didn&#39;t know who that was and after being ambushed in the baths long ago it was better to be safe than ending up like a weak idiot, passing out from a single blow.

So he looked at the Dwarf  that was just sitting there with her legs in the water for a second. He had his arms crossed over his chest and it didn&#39;t look like he was using his legs to keep afloat either, &quot;Another dwarf huh? You are the third one I see in this ship.

He growled a little and tried to focus again on just relaxing. <em>One, two...

Most of them hard a hard time in the water and had to move a lot to keep afloat. <em>Fuck.</em> There he goes, thinking about dwarves.

With a growl of frustration he just used his tail to make one powerful push and jumped our of the water, expertly landing on his feet. &quot;Next time use a fucking board.&quot; He growled, not really explaining himself as he started to walk out of the room. <em>What is with these fuckers?</em> He wondered, <em>always fucking with the places I use to fucking sleep</em> and with that he just left, probably to find some raw meat and then to wander around the ship. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Hal didn’t have on a true bathing suit, but decided her underthings would suffice all the same. A simple cami and panties and she was ready to try swimming. While she tested the water, she watched Garg do a perfect dive into the pool. Then again, he was a creature of the sea. The water his first and favorite home. If she was to support her Captain, she needed—and wanted—to become more familiar with it. Comfortable. It was necessary that being in water became second nature and natural. 

With a smile on her face, Hal submerged her lithe body into the cool pool waters and slowly began swimming towards the shark. It was quite the sight, if anyone happened to watch, seeing a young girl clumsily swim towards a large and deadly sea predator. “I am having fun,” she giggled, gasping and sputtering a bit, while she swam. She kicked her legs and moved her arms, managing to swim even if it wasn’t the most graceful. But at least she wasn’t sinking and at least she was moving towards her goal. </div>

Don&#39;t fight the water and don&#39;t be afraid of sinking. Remember what I told you, if you keep breathing air, your body will easily float and a slow graceful movement can push you farther than a fast desperate one.&quot; He explained with a grin on his face before diving down and swimming like a shark around the elf.

He stopped a few feet in front of her, &quot;See? Fucking fun!&quot; He cheered... Just then a big octopus tentacle sneaked behind the sharkin and wrapped itself around his neck. Garg eyes widened a little while looking at Hal, &quot;Oh fuck!&quot; He managed to roar before the tentacle quickly pulled him down.

A minute passed and there was no sign of Garg in the water... It was like he had never been in the pool with Hal in the first place. </div>

Captain!” she cried, eyes becoming visibly wet with her tears. The sharkin was no where to be found, but that tentacle was ever growing, reaching upward and engulfing her in its shadow. In that moment, she flailed her arms, desperately seeking the pool’s edge. “Wh-what! What!” Fear coursed through the girl’s veins, but then she remembered... Garg was tied to the kraken. That otherworldly beast from a plane elsewhere. Trying to steady her breaths, she faced the large creeping tentacle. “The Captain...” she started. “Where is he? What did you do to him?” She scanned the pool, but the shark was still no where in sight. “Bring him back to me. I... I’m his first mate!” she then shouted, steeling her nerves and setting her jaw. If this beast was going to take him away, then it would have to deal with her... despite the odds being in the sea beast’s favor. </div>

It wasn&#39;t long until a humanoid bode appeared in front of Hal. It looked like it was female, eyes were black with red irises, skin tanned and very little clothing only covering the necessary bits to appear decent enough. &quot;I have been watching you splashy elf.&quot; The kraken told Hal, a ominous half smile appearing on her? face. </div>

The girl just stared at the kraken not quite sure how to process things. 

“Are... are you...” Hal stammered, her wet red hair sticking to her body, while she clutched the pool’s edge. “Are you the kraken?” She tilted her head, eyeing this sea creature with fascination and curiosity, though her body still trembled in her presence. “Where’s the Captain?” she then asked.

No wonder you got exhausted by just a simple dip into the sea.&quot; Whole she? talked, the tentacles never stopped growing out of the pool.

&quot;But there&#39;s something about you... You have a sharp mind...&quot; One of the tentacles reached for Hal and it&#39;s tip touched the elf&#39;s face, slowly tracing her jaw and pushing her face to one way and the other like it was examining her. &quot;Too filled with regrets and doubts... You dread being a dissapointment don&#39;t you?... Not the kind of visceral fear I enjoy.&quot; The tanned woman shook her? head and crossed her? humanoid arms under her? breasts. &quot;I guess it&#39;s a good thing. Specially if you want to sail with Garg......&quot; The tentacle stopped touching Hal but only pulled back a little, not touching her anymore but still fairly close to her.

&quot;As for where he is? Don&#39;t worry. I treat my captain&#39;s fairly well. But this is a conversation not for him...&quot; the kraken finally said, a ominous smile appeared on her? beautiful face. </div>

She’d heard tales of pact magic, whispers and rumors spoken amongst the others within the inner circle, and on occasion, even the courts. 

“Not meant for him?” Hal asked, not understanding what this great beast wanted with her when it was the sharkin whom held the pact. “I... I don’t understand,” she went on. “What exactly is it we need to discuss that wouldn’t involve the Captain?” The girl looked up at the kraken with wide eyes, a bit unsettled that this otherworldly being somehow saw into her heart, her past. “And what do you know of my past?” she went on, every utterance by this creature causing the elf to have more and more questions. </div>

The water vibrating with it.

&quot;I know very little about you... Your fear, it tells me everything I need...&quot; She? moved closer to Hal, only a couple of feet separating their faces. &quot;But this is not about what you had done, no.

“What I signed up for?” Hal then stated aloud. There hadn’t been a contract, but she knew how she felt about the Captain. “I’m not sure I understand...” The girl frowned then, wishing the kraken would just explain and not leave her mind muddled, and guessing. “The Captain and I have several plans, but we must first start at the beginning,” she then went on to explain. “Do you disapprove?” she asked, wondering just what this strange creature might know. “How do you even know what we’re preparing for?” </div>

&quot;So many questions pop up inside that cute red heard of yours but your pointy ears hear very few answers.... Look underneath of the underneath. Make your mind be running several leagues ahead of your rivals. Stop pausing for questions, instead sail away for answers. Sharkins are not the best at being direct with words...&quot; the amused smile on the kraken&#39;s face turn it into a mischievous one. &quot;Specially sharkin pups.... I can&#39;t wait to see you struggle with both of them and see how Garg reacts. That <em>Boogeyman</em> is a great source of amusement and seek him react to that will be very funny.&quot;

With those final ominous words the kraken pulled back, lowering herself? into the darkness of the bottomless pool. &quot;You worry about his heart... But you already have a greater piece of your captain.&quot;

In a few moments the kraken and tentacles dissapeared, the sharkin&#39;s head breaking the surface of the water a couple of feet from Hal like he had been there all this time. &quot;Fucking asshole...&quot; Garg growled angrily. </div>

She held no part of the Captain, though she supposed he’d metaphorically captured her heart. But somehow, she was sure this wasn’t exactly what Garg’s patron had meant. 

Mind filled with questions and even less answers, Hal moved deeper into the water, as the kraken began taking her leave. “Wait!” she cried out. “Wait!” At that, the girl began swimming towards where the beast had been, as she got there, Garg suddenly surfaced. Angry. Upset. “Captain?” she squeaked, reaching out for the sharkin and burying her face against his cool chest. “I... I met her, Captain. I met the kraken.” </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Garg instinctively wrapped one muscly arm around the elf&#39;s waist, pulling her closer to him and easily keeping her afloat in the cool water. Now the darkness at the bottom of the pool has dissapeared, the clear blue floor of the pool could be seen again.

The sharkin was more annoyed than angry. After all he was used to the kraken assholish ways, and when it was really important the badger could be of great help... Like when it had saved him from a certain and pathetic death. &quot;Asshole bastard...&quot; Garg grumbled as he pushed his snout into the crook of Hal&#39;s neck. &quot;What did the bastard want with you shadow girl?&quot; Well, that was really interesting despite everything. Since the whole heart fiasco and then the weird bird visiting the pool, the kraken had been quiet, not really messing with him as much as before.

While he waited for Hal to calm down and answer him, Garg just kept gently floating thanks to the slow movements of his tail. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Hal just quietly held onto Garg, while he kept them both afloat. “She wasn’t unkind,” she started. “Nor did she try to hurt me. More...” The girl was trying to find the right words. “It felt like she was inspecting me. She said she already knew much, that she’d been watching me.” The red head leaned her head against the shark, her arms encircling what would be his neck. “But what struck me most,” she continued, her legs moving to wrap about Garg’s waist. “Was that she said I already held a piece greater than your heart.” She pulled back just enough to look up into the shark’s red eyes. “Do you know what that might mean? What could be greater or more important than your heart?”

Truly, Hal was perplexed. She honestly had no idea what it could be that she held of Garg’s. They hadn’t found his heart, nor did she know if he’d even want them sharing a heart per the legends. As of right then, the only other thing of his she had were those tools. But somehow she didn’t think that could be it. They were a gift, yes. And valuable. But tools like that could be purchased in shops. So just what had the kraken meant? </div>

Then he chuckled a little, the sounds coming from him were more like short stopped growls than anything else. &quot;Anything can be better than a useless piece of fucking dying muscle...&quot; Maybe that fucker was talking about the position of first mate, after all that was the best thing one of his crew members could hold. The right to being called the Boogeyman of the sea&#39;s right hand man... or woman in this case. 

Then a teasing smile appeared on his face, directed at the elf &quot;But know something great that you can hold later...&quot; He growled and thrusted his hips upwards, making her feel how his body was reacting to hers. </div>

For a moment, her legs tightened even more about him, but she pulled back just enough to look up into those fierce red eyes. “Dying muscle, or not. It’s your heart, Captain. If you wanted it back, or...” The girl swallowed hard. “Or even mended... I’d help you see it done.” Her face grew instantly hot, her eyes lowering for a moment.

True, Hal hadn’t known if Garg even wanted that piece of himself back. But upon meeting the pirate and learning his story, she’d found herself almost obsessed with helping him heal. Regardless, she’d be there for him moving forward. That was what mattered, what was important. 

“Still, I wonder what she meant. And why it meant all that strange... inspecting.” Hal pursed her lips, trying to understand what would make such a beast say such things. Or... even care at all. While she thought on it, she felt Garg grow hard, his hips pressing firmly against her. “Mmmfff...” she groaned softly. If the shark wasn’t careful, he’d work her up and their swimming lesson would end up all but forgotten.

“Careful, Captain,” Hal teased back. “I’m not sure if distractions will help me improve my swimming skills.” She giggled then, the heat of her sex no doubt felt by the shark, while he held her. </div>

He didn&#39;t want to talk about his heart, the mistake he had made that almost cost him not only his life but his dream of becoming a legend and commando the cursed galleon.

Intead he leaned forward and bumped his nose with hers before pulling back. &quot;Did you see how that bastard moved through the water? That&#39;s how you need to swim... Slow... Smooth... Like I&#39;m doing now.&quot; He explained as he moves his hands to her hips, ready to let her go so she could start swimming again. Before they got derailed again he needed to teach her how to move in the water, she may need it for their raid on the feywild. </div>

She nodded then, her expression actually shy. “Yes, Captain,” she then answered. “Her tentacles never stopped moving. It was like they somehow understood the water, worked with it.” She felt Garg’s hands on her hips then, though he held her loosely, ready to let her continue trying to swim. 

Hal leaned back, looking up at the ceiling of the pool room, while she gently moved her arms, trying to mimic the way the kraken had moved. Her dancing lessons had paid off more than she’d realized, her body almost undulating along with the gentle ripples of the water. Before long, she was floating, relaxed on the surface of the water. “How’s this, Captain?” she then asked, also remembering how to focus her breathing the way Garg had instructed during one of their baths. </div>

He let Hal float for a couple of minutes before he resurfaced again besides her. &quot;Now it&#39;s when it gets interesting...&quot; He growled mischievously at her before he raised his arm and then brought it down hard.

The movement splashed some water and caused it to ripple around them... But it didn&#39;t stop. Whatever the sharkin did, it caused the calm pool turn into something like the sea, with small currents and waves going all around them. &quot;Let&#39;s see how you do now when it&#39;s more like the real sea shadow girl...&quot; Despite the new waves and currents, Garg remained floating there, from his waist up out of the water and looking down at the floating elf. Someone would think that he was standing on something to be able to remain like that, but such was he ease in the water that he could do something like that only barely moving his shark tail. </div>

In a mild panic, she began flailing again, her lungs working hard to get the swallowed water out of her lungs. 

“Captain...” Hal gasped, still coughing, though she tried her best to mimic those strange movements of the kraken. Though she was far from settled, at least she managed to keep her head above the water. It was far better than she’d managed on that job. She just needed time and practice. “Captain...” she yelped again, still coughing quite hard. </div>

&quot;Not so easy now huh?&quot; He growled at her and pushed a little with his tail he they rose a little more above the water and Hal would be able to easily catch her breath. &quot;Calm down shadow girl... Remember that the water doesn&#39;t move fast as air. Control your breathing and let the water get out of you before trying to breathe again.&quot; He explained while he tightened his grip on her with one arm firmly locked around her waist and his other hand pulling one of her legs around his  waist.

&quot;You good now?&quot; He growled after a few moments. The water around them kept being alive like the one at the sea had been, whatever magic Garg was using it was still at works on the pool. </div>

For several moments, she buried her head against him, feeling utterly embarrassed at her failure. She wanted to be good at this. And... she would be, though it might take her a while to finally master everything. Still, she hoped the Captain could be patient, and help her find a way to become that first mate she know he needed. 

“Yes,” Hal said softly, pulling back then so she could look back up into Garg’s red eyes. “I <em>will</em> get this,” she continued, determination on her face. “I’ve just never needed to be in the water so much. But I won’t let that stop me.” Her jaw was set, while her legs remained wrapped about the sharkin’s waist. “I just need more practice and help.” The girl gave him a smile, her own heart hoping he knew how much this meant to her. How much she planned to try. 

Hal looked about the pool, the water rising and falling like breath. “So how would someone like me tackle this?” she then asked. “I cannot breathe the water. And I can only hold it for so long. So, how do I make sure my lungs are never hindered or harmed, while moving through something so wild?” It was an honest question. Garg and the kraken could take as long as they wanted to move through the water. Their bodies and biology were designed to accepted it, breathe it. It was a clear advantage. Was it even possible for someone like her to overcome such obstacles? The girl could only hope. </div>

&quot;You have the answer shadow girl... You hold your fucking breath.&quot; He growled at her, his strong arms still holding her against him, keeping most of her above the water. &quot;That&#39;s how you land dwellers do it. If you try to breathe too fucking much you&#39;ll end up swallowing water but holding your breath you can move for a few minutes before you need more air.&quot; At least that&#39;s what he had seen others do, specially his own mother when he forgot her magic cloak.

While he waited for Hal to be ready again, the sharkin started to allow the currents to pull move them around so Hal would be able to start feeling the power of the moving water and get a better idea how to handle it. </div>

Maybe, with practice, she could do so for at least a couple minutes. At least, that would be her goal. She knew there was no way to do longer. Not without magic somehow intervening, though it did make her wonder what sort of magic might aid in such circumstances. 

For a few more moments, Hal remained there in Garg’s arms. But she took those moments of quiet to just close her eyes and to listen and feel the water. The girl steadied her breathing, feeling her lungs expand and empty, each breath deeper than the one before. Finally, she sucked in as much air as she could and let herself just sink under those strange rolling waves of pool water. 

Beneath the turbulence, things were much more calm. Perhaps, Hal needed to learn how to swim under the water as well as above. She nodded then, knowing this was exactly something she needed to do. She though on the way she’d seen Garg swim, and the kraken. And while she had no tail or tentacles, she could mimic them the best her body would allow. So she had her muscles move, body and bones undulating with the current. The girl kept her legs together, trying to swim almost like she was a mermaid instead of the elf she was. It wasn’t perfect. But it was a start. 

When Hal popped back up for more air, she’d made it back to the pool’s edge. Just how bad she managed that all by herself in rough water? Her eyes went wide, and she sought out her Captain, hoping her efforts would somehow please him. </div>

&quot;Ha! Look at that shadow girl!&quot; He cheered before the tool a dip himself. In exactly 1 second he resurfaced in front of Hal, almost like he had teleported underwater but no, it was just his great speed since he was one of the fastest sharkins alive.

The pirate grinned at Hal and bumped his nose against her, &quot;See? It&#39;s not that hard when you don&#39;t fight the water...&quot; He growled at the wide eyed elf as his arms took a hold of her body again. </div>

Of course, she was well aware this was just a first step. But, it was still nice to make a little bit of progress at least. 

“Yes, Captain,” Hal said happily, her face going red, as Garg pulled her close. “But I’ll keep trying. I don’t ever want what happened before on that job to happen again. It...” Her voice trailed a bit. “It was embarrassing. And I don’t want to risk another job in that way again.” She gave the shark a nuzzle, her tummy suddenly rumbling again, making her giggle. 

“I guess all that exercise and learning worked up my appetite,” Hal mused. “Perhaps we can grab a quick snack and then take a nap? I wouldn’t mind a rest either.” </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Garg growled when Hal nuzzled him, his arms tightening around her in response. He really was enjoying this physical contact thing, not only the fucking but everything else too... 

And Hal was way better than Ena in his book.... The shakin shook his head a little, dismissing those thoughts since he didn&#39;t want to think about that fiasco. Instead he looked down and Hal and laughed a little when he felt her stomach asking for food. &quot;Alright shadow girl, that was good enough for a first try.&quot; He told her.

Then he smiled in that way of his and lowered his mouth to her ear. &quot;Take a deep breath and don&#39;t close your eyes no matter what...&quot; He growled at her. This was something his mother told him she always enjoyed, and while Hal was quite different perhaps she would too.

Once she had done as he asked, he let their bodies sink into the water. Once they were both completely underwater his looked into the elf eyes and grinned wider. <span class="spoiler spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"><span class="spoiler-text">&quot;Here we fucking go!&quot;</span></span> He cheered in aquan before they were off.

Like a bullet Garg shot through the calm waters of the pool, swimming as fast as he could and making Hal feel a little bit of the rush he always felt in the ocean. He made a couple of fast laps around the pool, without even looking since he eyes never left her face. Then he finally took them to the bottom of the pool before he shot them upwards, making them fly out of the water and land a few feet out of the pool. Thankfully he landed on his feet. &quot;Hahah! What do you think shadow girl?&quot; </div>

The girl steadied her breathing and took the deepest breath that she could, her eyes remaining fixed on Garg’s. She felt the rush of water all about their bodies, the current eddies swirling and tumbling with every fluid movement. It was exhilarating, a reminder of why she would never give up. Why she’d spend the rest of her life with her Captain. 

Hal heard Garg’s words, while they moved through the water. And though she didn’t understand what he’d said, his expression told her all she’d needed to know. After several thrilling moments, the girl found herself back on dry ground, her body held tightly in Garg’s cool embrace. “Oh... oh my...” she whispered, a smile upon her lips. “I’ve never experienced anything like that before. It was... fun,” she admitted, giggling a bit, while playing what had just happened over and over in her head. 

Just happy in the moment, Hal leaned her head against Garg’s chest. “Captain?” she then asked. “What language was that you were speaking in the water? It’s unfamiliar to me. Is it your first language?” </div>

&quot;That, shadow girl... Is fucking aquan, the underwater language.&quot; He looked down at the elf still in his arms, his wife grinn never leaving his shark face. &quot;It&#39;s half learned and half instinct.... The actual language is called primordial...&quot; He explained and leaned back on the chair. Hal was hungry but he knew that the ones not used to it would feel their bodies very heavy after being in the water for a while, so he would give her a few minutes to adapt to the change.

He just closed his eyes and relaxed back, there was nothing better like a good swim, even if it was a short one for him. Also he really enjoyed how the almost naked elf felt against his body. &quot;We use fucking glyphs like the dwarves...&quot; He growled suddenly, &quot;but in a different way... Maybe I&#39;ll teach ya after you get good enough with the navigation...&quot; </div>

Just like she’d make it a point to become both a better swimmer and a better crew member. After all, if she was to be his first mate, then she needed to be the best. Being his lover... it meant as much even more. 

“Well, I’d love to learn,” Hal said. “If you’d like I can also teach you Elvish. Might be nice to know each other’s first languages,” she said, blushing, while holding tightly onto Garg. A little worried he wouldn’t care to learn about her culture or background, she suddenly moved to bury her face against him. “But you don’t have to, if you don’t care to know such things.” While she spoke the words, a Hope filled her heart that he would. </div>

Or having a way to speak without then knowing... Very smart of ya, haven&#39;t thought about it until now...&quot; He was quite comfortable, just leaning back on the chair and holding the warm elf against his body, specially nice since they were still wet.

Eyes still closed, his hands started to roam around the elf&#39;s body, even going under her wet clothes to feel her directly. The more tightly Hal held onto him, the more he could feel his body reacting, his dick growing hard in his pants and rubbing against the softness of his first mate. which made him release some specially hard growls. 

&quot;What other do you know? I didn&#39;t have time for new languages... Too busy learning about sailing and ships.&quot; He asked while he waited for the elf to get used to being on land again so they could go to eat something, he would never say no to food. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">It was quite comfortable lying there atop the shark, his arms holding her tightly, as if she were his most treasured of possessions. Absently, Hal began nuzzling Garg, her body rubbing against him, and causing a bit of a reaction. She had to admit that it felt nice to be desired—both in body and in mind. It made her feel special and wanted, like she mattered deeply and had somehow touched another’s soul. Of course, underneath it all, the girl was a hopeless romantic. But was it wrong to dream and to hope?

Hal felt Garg’s arousal, her own slowly growing knowing just their closeness was having an affect. “I don’t know many,” she admitted. “Elvish and something called Thieves’ Cant. The Cant is rather nuanced though, it’s not just words, but also sounds and gestures and expressions. It all works together and allows for a very covert way of communicating.” She let out a soft groan then, enjoying the way his hands were starting to move over her body. 

“I can also speak telepathically,” Hal then explained. “Not sure if you noticed or remember, but...” Her face reddened, her body starting to squirm atop Garg, when his hands moved under the camisole and brushed against a sensitive nipple. “I did so with you... mmmfff... on that job. Only downfall is that it’s one way, unless you have this ability as well... nnggg...”

If Garg wasn’t careful, he’d end up working Hal up. Her mind already a bit muddled from his caresses and petting. Just as she was about to moan, it was cut short by a soft rumble of her tummy, making her giggle just a bit. </div>

The shaking opened his red eyes and looked at the elf on top of him and just started to laugh in that growly way if his. &quot;Ha! Looks like you can speak in one more way shows girl!&quot; He teased her a little, his wandering hand giving her sensitive nipple a final pinch before he took them away from inside her wet clothes.

After he stopped laughing he shook his head a little, both hand now just resting on her hips. &quot;You&#39;ll teach me that code language shadow girl... It can be very useful if it&#39;s like you said.&quot; He growled at her, &quot;And I remember, very fucking useful. How far can you do that?&quot; That magic of hers was going to come in handy every time they needed to be quiet... Even if it wasn&#39;t his style.

The sharkin sat up in the lounge chair and removed his hands from Hal so she could get up. &quot;Alright shadow girl, let&#39;s find something to eat and then...&quot; A wide grin appeared on his face, showing her his sharp teeth. &quot;...then we can have dessert.&quot; </div>
