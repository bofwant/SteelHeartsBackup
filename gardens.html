I didn&#39;t know that the Steel Hearts would have places like this on board...&quot; After he said it, he turned his head towards Copper, trying to see her reaction to the garden as well, being rather excited to spend some time with his new friend in a place like this </div>

She plucked a little flower and began to fiddle with it, tucking the stem underneath her bandanna as she spoke.  &quot;I&#39;ve heard about places like this.  Think I&#39;ve even seen a few.  You know wizard towers?  Trap filled Dungons?  They&#39;re called Manses.  Buildings Built on Magical places... I&#39;ve even heard some of them move.&quot;

She looked back to him, a purple violet blood amongst the fins and tendrils that was her hair.  She had her arms behind her and gave him that cute look.  She slithered to him and grabbed his arm.  &quot;Maybe there&#39;s something magical here!&quot;  She pulled him deeper into the gardens. </div>

That sounds pretty amazing... Maybe we can go to places like that, now that we are both adventurers!&quot; He said it with a bright, and friendly smile on his face, thinking of Copper as a close friend now

Then, as she has dragged him along, he chuckled a bit, trying to keep up with the enthusiastic yuanti to the best of his ability &quot;Hey! Watch out! I almost tripped over!&quot; As the two of them were going deeper into the garden, Alex couldn&#39;t help but to adore almost every single one of the plants, feeling like he just couldn&#39;t get enough of it, while giving a few occasional glances towards Copper to make sure that she was having fun along with him </div>

She looked to him as she noticed that things got a little darker within.  As if they were in a place that cut the light.  &quot;What about you?

&quot;You see... I actually come from a noble family... I just... Don&#39;t have any amazing talents like the rest of my family does, so I decided to head out, and live from the money that I make, and not the money that my family does...&quot;

He then released a bit of a sigh, while still keeping his body close to hers without seeming to be bothered by it too much &quot;You probably think it is foolish, but... I don&#39;t think that I&#39;m fit to be a noble, so that&#39;s why I decided to just... Help people as a living instead of trying to be rich for my own needs...&quot; </div>

He was too nice.  It wouldn&#39;t last but part of her wished it would.  She sighed, resigned.  &quot;Kind of expected that.  Oh well, you&#39;re one of the good ones.&quot;    Then she began to think more practically.  She winked.  &quot;I think you&#39;d look great in a Blue Jade Breastplate.&quot;

She made an interested noise when he turned to her.  &quot;What!?&quot;  She said, aghast, her hand going over her mouth.  &quot;You&#39;re a-a- you&#39;re-a- SSSsshhh...ss You&#39;re a prince?&quot;  She kept her voice down.  She looked at him as he dropped the bombshell, and then explained himself.

She raised her hands, putting them together.  There was a moment between them.  &quot;I think...&quot;  She began, a sudden softness.  &quot;I think that&#39;s pretty brave Alex.&quot;  She said.  &quot;Not very smart.&quot;  She chuckled.   &quot;But- but brave.  You didn&#39;t want to sit on your back, try to fake something your not.  You&#39;re here, fighting.  Adventuring.  You might not be a noble.

I don&#39;t think that the royal family even has people like me, since I&#39;d assume that most people there are full of talents...&quot;

Then, as she said that he was brave, his smile softened even more, soon letting out a sigh of relief before speaking to her in a slightly more direct tone while looking into her eyes &quot;I&#39;m really glad that you understand me so easily... Honestly... I was a little worried about telling others at first... But a hero? That might be a little too far away from the still, but even if I&#39;m not like a true hero... I like helping people if they need it...&quot;

After he said that, he walked over to a tree, soon sitting down right next to it, leaning against it before signing a bit, looking towards Copper to see if she would want to follow him or not </div>

Irithriel’s heart had been so very heavy ever since that encounter at Primal Point. She felt empty and lost and just when she wasn’t sure she could keep herself together, those little darlings would find her and bring a sweet smile to her pretty face. She’d taken the time to write out her pleas to the guild, to have that mysterious opal appraised, the jewel being worth 1000gp. She hoped that would be enough, but... it hadn’t been. No one had sought her out expressing a desire to find her beloved beast and, if it came down to it, she knew she’d go it alone. 

The past several days had felt so very wrong, the bed colder than it should be. Iri shivered then, her slippered feet padding lightly through the lush greens of the garden. The scent of lilacs were heavy in the air—sweet and heady, reminding her of the Feywild. But those days were long gone, or so she’d decided. She had new memories to make and a future to build and... Mors. His name was like a chant within her brain, everything she knew about him coursing through her veins. She finally came upon a small tree and sat down, her thin dress fanning out about her. She set down her things and then hugged her knees to her chest for several moment. Oh, she’d have to bring Mors here... he’d hate it, of course. She knew that. But she also knew his face would light up when he saw how much she loved the place. </div>

To help occupy her mind, she decided to learn how to mend and sew. Magic proved useful, to a point, but she needed her fingers to learn the craft. She’d loved all the dresses Mors saw that she got, but to make one... really make one. Or a quilt or pillow or... sweaters. The girl smiled at the thought of making Mors his very own sweater. He’d hate everything about it, except that it was something she’d taken the time to make... for him. That alone would be enough. “Mors...” she whimpered softly, her hands reaching for needle and thread. Slowly, carefully, she began with something small... just a handkerchief, as her first item to try. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Iri was humming to herself, while she carefully stitched the handkerchief. She’d been working for hours, lost both in thought and the magical beauty of the gardens. How she wished her Mors was there. The girl had just finished up a stitch when suddenly she heard something bounding towards her. She set down her things, delicate fingers grabbing her dress, so that she could get up quickly if she needed to. But her worries subsided when she was met with Phantom’s sweet face. Oh yes, she remembered him, along with his companion. 

Iri shifted, kneeling beside the massive dog. She reached out to pet him, if he’d let her, while her eyes started searching for Warden. “Warden?” she said aloud, knowing the goliath had to be nearby. “Are you there? It’s me. Irithriel.” She looked back to Phantom and smiled. It was nice to see a friendly face, especially during such dark times for herself. </div>

The grass was lush and soft beneath her, she looked like a creature of the Feywild. “Warden?” she then spoke, her hands still petting Phantom, before she leaned in to give the beast an affectionate kiss. “Oh Warden... he’s gone and I... I am beside myself.” The pretty elf stood up, brushing herself off, as she looked up into the Goliath’s eyes. In her hand she held the handkerchief. It was her first one and it showed. But no matter. It gave her something to do and learn. Something that might eventually be a way to give back to others. 

“I’ve put up an advertisement,” Iri went on, taking a step closer to Warden. “Would you...” She suddenly worried she’d be in this alone, that no one would care. “Would you help me find him. Please.” A few tears fell then. “I love him, Warden. I miss him. I... I need help if I’m to bring him home. Will you help me?” She knew she was being selfish. No doubt the giant man had come to the gardens for peace. And now, there she was asking him to risk his life for another. </div>

Pulling away, she looked up at him with wide and hopeful eyes. “I... I know he seems boorish and brooding, but...” She smiled a bit, remembering how she could make her beast laugh and smile, find joy and peace. She knew her Mors loved her deeply. Nothing could ever make her doubt that. “But he does love me back, Warden. He does. And I’ll do anything to get him back safely.” She swallowed lightly. “Maybe the two of you could be friends. He... he needs friends, Warden. Maybe another like him. Like you.” She gave him a reassuring nod, one letting him know she believed this with all her heart. The girl then glanced at the sloppily made handkerchief in her hands. She held it up for him. “It’s for Mors,” she said. “And it’s... it’s terrible.” </div>

She gave the goliath a nod. “I’m certain he will take it,” she then said. “He knows it would make me happy and he also knows why such a thing would.” The girl blushed then. It was obvious she was deeply in love and cared greatly for the man she so desperately wanted to find. 

Lowering her gaze, Iri let her one hand play with the lacy material of her dress. Her other hand fisted the handkerchief and she held it up, grinning sheepishly. “If you could help me,” she said in response to Warden’s kind gesture. “I would love that.” Her gray eyes scanned the stitching he’d done on his own clothes, the work rather impressive. “I... I thought it might be nice to learn. I’d love to get better. I... I see myself making Mors sweaters.” Her blush darkened then, a shy smile tugging the corners of her lips. “He would hate them.” She looked back up at Warden then. “But... but he’d wear them proudly.

Even if it was not true, it was best not to anger her. She didnt look like someone he would rather have as an enemy anyways. He listens to Irithriel explain the situation. Remembering well the encounter they had at the so called primal point. Giving a soft nod he releases the hand, allowing it to fall from his grasp and back to her. Standing up straight again he scratches Phantoms head</em> &quot;Mors may be a prick at times and a brute in every sense of the word, but as car as I can tell he is still a good man. Irithriel here promises that he is not all hard shell.&quot; <em>He looks over to the trees and imagines a flock of birds from back home roosting in thick branches and leaved.</em> &quot;It is like an egg. Hard on the outside. Protecting the soft interior from harm. But eventually the exterior falls and the soft bird will grow out. Mors is the same as far I can tell. An egg that needs time to hatch. He seems to have for some and from what I can tell.

Of course her head was... <em>how can I benefit from this?</em>

&quot;Oh honey sweetie!  Im so sorry!&quot;  Her hands unfortunately have to abandon the dog as she goes to Iri&#39;s side.  She offers the girl a hug, a tight one and a shoulder to cry on, her tail almost threatening to coil.

He threw the door open into a rather magnificent almost magical green house filled with species of flora that were almost magical.&#160; “This is the Gardens. We import alot of supplies but for what can be grown grows here.” He stood proudly, his chest out as he looked to the sun shining in.&#160; Indeed, verdant green was just the backdrop to the reds and violets and yellows, little wisps and pixie creatures flitting about happily.

Indeed it was another example of just how the ship bent space.&#160; There is no way this room could fit in here and yet, here it was.&#160; One could go outside and see a utility closet next door, when logic would dictate it should go right into the room. </div>

We can do the formalities here. Its much more colorful than my office.”

Phoenix Dawn takes faith’s pamphlet, explaining her lack of words, this makes the loud and boisterous half angel smile and laugh.&#160; “Ahh, Faith, a worthy name for the devout and the pious. Have no fear, I will speak for the both of us if you ever wish to engage.”&#160; He kneels before her. “Mask or none.” He bows his head. “Tis an honor to have another comrade upon my side and another beauty to brighten up these old halls.”&#160; He offered a hand to kiss if she willed it, but then would stand up again. When she and Nova were discussing he puts a hand to his chin. “Indeed. And allow me to add my <strong>BEAUTIFUL MAN VOICE</strong> to your dance.&#160; Will truly be a wondrous night.”

Cassius began to explain.&#160; “The Guild is a family business Ms. Nova.&#160; I provide a roof, supplies, and comforts in return for you to go out into the world as heroes, your brothers and sisters at your side. &#160; You need only swear that you will protect your guild mates on your journeys, and you will be welcomed with open arms.”
Dawn nods to Zzo.&#160; “Ah yes. I’ve read of your exploits on that mission as well.&#160; It put us squarely in their targets, and is why we needed to beef security.&#160; My hope is to take the fight to them before the Heart has to deal with them.

“Aye.&#160; And we already have seen them on the move.&#160; Launching a Crusade like the one during the War of Remnants.&#160; There are no undead to find though.”

“So they target the reformed fiends... curse them.&#160; The Ebony and Satinites have brought us gems like Riwo, and the Lady Nova.” </div>

Nova is released with the turn of the palm allowing her to literally stand on its, a gnarle of branches that could generously be called a hand, fingets inteaced with leaves and pine cones.

When Faith jumps up and down, the treant does the same, grabbing her in a ball of brambles before shes in the air too.

Dawn is just laughing.  &quot;Magnus is a treant.  A wood elemental.  Wouldnt hurt a fly so dont worry.&quot;

Magnus just seemed to look at both with its yellow glowing eyes, and from there they have a view of what looks to be a forest, but over a sky of glass and support struts, like they were in an enormous green house. </div>

Phoenix Dawn at the time was standing just at the shoulder as well, taking a glance over to Nova and giving her a huge happy grin.  It was nice to see her really enjoying herself.  She seemed so full of joy and life.  Faith too, but she was quieter about it.

&quot;Im not going to lie.  I havent had this much fun in many days.  Usually my days are spent... saving damsels...  Battling monsters....Battling damsels.  I know this isn&#39;t the most exciting time, but Dammit, its moments like this that make it all worth while.  I hope we become friends for a long long time.&quot; </div>

“To escape that life... I can’t even imagine.”&#160; He began considering it. “That’s... unfair. That’s awful...”&#160; No wonder why the Church was considered the good guys by so many even if they were infernalists.&#160; He turned his head.&#160;&#160;
How many fiends did he slay, did he banish?&#160; How many were just defending themselves, their lives here.&#160; “It’s a miracle.” He said. “Its a miracle that you can still smile like that.”&#160; He said to her, feeling a moments warmth is shared. ‘Your mother sounds like a brave woman.&#160; I hope she is well, and I know she is proud.” He looks towards the glass ceiling.

It wouldn’t be the first time his looks had got him the favor of a fair maiden.&#160; Considering they were talking family though, watching the view, she shared her tale. Still... he could smell her, and it was enough to make his skin brighten a little in sheen.&#160;&#160;
Her tale had with it, a ritual.&#160; She played with his hand, holding it up to the heavens, she blocked out the light.&#160; His hands were marred with battles in the hundreds. Hers were soft, dainty... They were in every way opposite hers, and yet she manipulated them so easily.&#160; She spoke of light, and he looked. She spoke of shadow and he looked. She spoke of piercing the darkness and her fingers began to interlace and he looked. His eyes glowed to that little light between his fingers, and how her words seemed to make it... shine.&#160; Shine that much brighter. It was like he was entranced. Like he was where he should be, where he needed to be.
Did he ever have that?&#160; He thought. Mother or father.&#160; Someone who could just- tell him a story and use his hand as a metaphor.&#160; And make everything just seem right and hopeful and good. When his hand was placed into her lap, and she touched her face, his glowing eyes shed a single tear, rolling down her perfect cheek.&#160;&#160;
He smiled, he always smiled.&#160; He never needed someone to lift his lips.&#160; But it was effort, her tale was inspiring... but sad.&#160; Could anyone be like that for her? </div>

He said using his free hand to wipe the tear a way and quickly.&#160; Tears were weakness. He should have looked away, but her hand keeping his smile. He did on his own, reaching to put his hand on hers.&#160; “You don’t need to do that to make me smile. Every time I see you, I’ll remember the story. Ill remember that little light when all is lost.&#160; Who knows.” His hand gently stroking her hand, her wrist. “You might have saved my life from what you did at this moment. Thank you.”
He averted his eyes, feeling unworthy.&#160; “But at the same time, it makes me sad. Sad that your mother isn’t here to share this moment.&#160; Sharing that light with a total stranger.” He gripped her hands. “Someday I’ll repay you. Someday push back the shadow so that you never have to look for the brightness beyond.”&#160; He then laughed. “Sorry, my poetry is sorely lacking.”
He then did realize they were still looking at eachother, her hands still comforting him, their bodies so close.&#160; That smell again... </div>

Setting his ballista up next to him. Taking out his weaving kit he takes time with the spider silk they had gathered. Beginning the making of a hat for him. The sounds growing and calling around him.

They didn&#39;t expect this. How the hell could they have expected this? They&#39;d never met another changeling that they knew of, and he- well, maybe this was just how he preferred to look but he didn&#39;t <em>look</em> like Thrin did. They sigh. Fine. Fine, okay, fair is fair. 
They stop and look around before changing to their true shape- a slightly shorter, pure white figure with much longer and messier hair than the elf form though the ears are the same, lovely elven length. The expensive clothes weren&#39;t quite filled out properly in this form. Then they changed back, looking around for someone to have seen them. 
&quot;Okay, what- what&#39;s your deal. Are you usually so open with this? How long did you know? God, you didn&#39;t say anything did you?&quot; <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="14-Apr-20 08:51 PM">(edited)</span></div>

Gotta say, I never really expected to find another changeling. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever <em>not</em> kept it to myself, y&#39;know? Personal security. Some people are more clever than I&#39;d like, but in those cases I just leave.&quot;
They open their book and turn to a page displaying their current appearance. Some features gently adjust themselves: the eyes turn upwards, irises glow a little greener. Two freckles rearrange themselves in a precise attention to detail and, somehow, they&#39;re even able to mimic the faintly ethereal aura that so prominently radiates from true elves. It&#39;s clearly been practiced obsessively. They snap the book shut and look back up at Ford. 
&quot;And this is just between us?&quot; They need to confirm he isn&#39;t lying. They can&#39;t stand having somebody know, it feels wrong, but they can&#39;t erase his memory either. &quot;I&#39;ve only ever told one person. They framed me for something afterwards, and I dealt with them. Gotcha?&quot; </div>

Not that the wizard is much better, in different ways. The itch to go places and the desire to see <em>everything</em>, even if that desire is masked under the guise of a relentless greed for coin and lavish things. It&#39;s not all fake. It mostly isn&#39;t. It&#39;s just what they share. 
But now Thrin was sharing their closest, most terrifying secret to reveal, with a person they had just met. And he was like them. That was the strangest part. 
They stand carefully, brushing dirt off of their pants and sleeves precisely and then reach down to help Ford off the ground too. &quot;You need a proper writing boom, my friend&quot; they mutter off hand before asking, &quot;do you want to find ourselves some food?&quot; <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="16-Apr-20 01:59 PM">(edited)</span></div>

                    <div class="markdown">Mors arrived at the gardens and immediately a couple of his green minions jumped from the trees and landed in front of him like the little deadly assasins they were. &quot;Mors!&quot; They both echoed at the same time.

The overlord smiled under his dark helmet, only someone pretty close to him or with a very good vision would notice. &quot;I see that you found a place to your liking too...&quot; His deep voice sounded almost relaxed and echoed a little around them thanks to his evil powers. &quot;Where are the idiots and how many are keeping an eye on my queen?&quot; He asked them after a few seconds of silence elapsed.

The two loyal minions looked at eachother and one of them just shrugged and the other raised one finger. The answer clear to the overlord. 

Mors sighed and made a small movement with his head, &quot;Go find her and help her with anything she needs, I&#39;ll find the idiots.&quot; <em>I&#39;m sure they are already doing something stupid.</em> He thought as he stared to walk forward to search the gardens while his minions just dissapeared, camouflaging themselves with their surroundings and heading to find their mistress. </div>

They peeked into several rooms, but none of them seemed to be where her Mors had gotten off to. He hadn’t even been in their room. After a while, the girl led the goliath to the gardens. 

“This place is so beautiful,” Iri whispered, almost breathless. It was clear that this was a magical place for her. Somewhere she could go to re-energize and recharge. “It’s a favorite of mine, perhaps my beast is in here...” The girl skipped ahead just a little. “Mors... oh Mors...” she called out, her sweet voice a lilting melody. “Are you here, my beast? I’ve a new friend for you to meet!”

Iri’s excitement was evident, one hand clutching at her lacy skirt, while the other rested against her belly. She continued her humming, while leading Lonehunter deeper into the gardens. </div>

Or maybe that was just him; he&#39;d gone into underground caverns, the Katho-Olavi having dug a network of tunnels into the mountainsides to take shelter in during periods of storms. Something that happened far more often at their elevated levels than at sea-level. 

Indeed, though the gardens were nice; few things grew high on the mountains and  certainly nothing like this. He would often have to stumble upon such colorful plants foraging and hunting in the jungles around his home. Because of his travels, he never really had a time to appreciate nature&#39;s bounty as much as he should have. Challenging one-self rarely allowed for sight-seeing; perhaps that too could be a challenge. 

&quot;I am curious, Irithiel...Goliaths are known for their monumental power, but what led you to call him &#39;your beast&#39;?&quot; he would then ask her. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">“Mors.... Mors....” Irithriel called out in a song-song sort of voice. The pretty elf just giggled, her steps light as air despite her current condition. She had a feeling her mate was nearby. It was like a second sense calling out to her, luring her close. 

“Oh, you are, Lonehunter?” Iri said, smiling brightly. “As I said before, he is my beast and I am his beauty. You really need to read the fairytale.” The girl nodded then, snowy hair cascading over slim shoulders. “There’s actually an extra copy in the library,” she went on. “We take it out so very often. It’s our favorite one to discuss, you see.” Her expression turned thoughtful. “We agree that the ending was wrong though. Shouldn’t a beauty want her mate to keep his power, to remain the beast he is inside?”

At that, Iri placed a gentle hand on Lonehunter’s arm. With a smile, she urged he follow her deeper into the gardens, the scent of lilacs heavy in the air. “Hrmm...” she whispered. “I think my beast is close.” </div>

His thoughts were suddenly halted by the sight of his two blue minions. The two little idiots were splashing around in a pond, apparently not doing anything dangerous. What got into him was the sight of his pack. It was floating in the pond between them and all his things were out in the water as well. &quot;Of course....&quot; The overlord growled before closing his eyes and taking a deep breath.

For a second he thought that he heard the voice of his little elf calling for him but he dismissed it when he heard another splash. &quot;... You little shits, why is you are always doing something stupid while I&#39;m not around?&quot; He asked them, his power flaring a little with his anger.

The two minions stopped they playing and turned to face their overlord. &quot;Mors!... Mors!... Las cosas flotan!!&quot; They both cheered and pointed at his floating gear, completely ignorant of Mors anger.

He just growled again,  raised his now glowing Warhammer and blasted the water with it. &quot;Stop you little shits!!&quot; He scolded them, &quot;Take everything out of the water! Those are not toys!&quot; He practically screamed at them in his echoing voice while he glared with glowing green eyes. </div>

The dry air on the ship reminded him a bit of his mountain home, remembering coming out and seeing the cloud layers on dense days above him...But oh god, the rains that would come down where he lived. It was like having a waterfall sometimes, right over their very heads!

And he would start a bit as she pulled him along; indeed, she was rather strong for an elf! Her laughter like the chimes in human villages, dainty and willowy, as they bumbled through the garden to see a Goliath as tall as himself, seemingly quite enraged at what seemed to be goblin-like creatures...But blue. Honestly, Uthal had no idea what they were. &quot;That is your mate? He seems very powerful indeed, and dangerous. You have chosen well for a father to your children.&quot; he would say, going forth to approach the massive being. 

Indeed, as he got closer, he could feel unnatural power from this &#39;Mors&#39;, though he had no idea what it was. &quot;You are the one called Mors?&quot; he would then ask the overlord, his voice as rumbling as the stones that formed the mighty peaks of the world. &quot;I am Uthal Lonehunter Katho-Olavi; I was led here by your mate, Irithriel. It seems this ship champions strong warriors indeed.&quot; </div>

Mors just sighed and took a deep breath. &quot;This little assholes...&quot; He grumbled to himself but was stopped when this time he actually heard the sound his his mate. The overlord turned around and quickly noticed her pointing at him. He couldn&#39;t avoid to smile a little at the display but it dissapeared when he finally noticed the giant besides her who was not the warden. <em>&#39;Interesting...&#39;</em> has his only thought while the warrior approaching him and made his introduction.

After the other Goliath finished He waited a few seconds to answer, studying Uthal with his glowing eyes that were the only things that could be seen under his helmet. &quot;Yes. I am Mors... But make no mistake. I am no champion. I am the thing that fools need champions for.&quot; He finally answered, a dark chuckle escaped him afterwards after picturing Kings and queens sending champions to destroy him. It seemed that his good mood was not ruined yet by the little shits. So, after cutting the power flowing through the big Warhammer and letting it rest on the ground, Mors addressed the warrior again.

I am not like any of you. My strength is my own, I don&#39;t need any bullshit mountain to lend me anything.&quot; He answered, a deep growl coming from within the overlord.

Then he heard a splash behind him and he just sighed, his chest rising and falling nwith the motion. The blue minions were making a game of the take their Lord had given them and Mors didn&#39;t need to turn around to know that they, like always, were doing something stupid and/or embarrassing.

&quot;My lovely mate is right. The challenges are not easy to come by. But if you wish to challenge me, you will have to wait. My mate and I will join in a ceremony called marriage. That day, during the celebration, we will challenge each other and any fool brave enough to do so as well.&quot; Mors explained, &quot;As for today, I can see how useful one such as you are in battle. The other two giant fools were a dissapointment, turning in against their allies and only looking for themselves.&quot; He explained with an angry voice, his grip on the warhammer visibly tightening and the same glow that was coming from his eyes started to come from under his armor thanks to how now glowing marks.

Then Mors remembered that today he was going to train with his little elf, perhaps if this one joined them, the metal man would actually throw a challenge at them.
&quot;Join us today in out training battle and prove that you are not a fool can can do more than swing your weapon around like a youngling learning how to fight. Prove to me that you can fight in a real battlefield.&quot; </div>

Her focus and attention moving a bit more to the little scene unfolding in the pond. Gray eyes widening, she could see the little blue darlings... was it playing?... yes, playing with her mate’s gear. “Oh, sweet blues,” she whispered, moving closer, her sheer lacy frock billowing as she moved. Once at the shoreline, she tsk’d softly, waving a finger of disappointment. “Now darlings,” she began, kicking off her slippers and placing her feet in the gentle lapping waves of the pond waters. “You both know better. Clean this up,” she demanded, her tone firm and motherly, but also sweet and kind. 

After giving the blues the eye, though smiling the entire time, Iri turned towards Mors and Lonehunter at the mention of ‘battlefield’. “Oh, did you just extend invitation to our wedding, my beast?” At that, she clapped, her smile growing. “That would be lovely! Oh, I’m so pleased.” She then stepped out of the water, the hem of her gown damp, and moved next to her Mors. Their size difference was a little unnerving at first glance, but it was easy to tell just how natural it was. “Are we training with Lonehunter today, my beast?” she asked, the pretty elf then looking towards Lonehunter and hoping he’d say ‘yes’. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Uthal nodded at Mors&#39; words, though the word &#39;bullshit&#39; was unknown to him; the tone indicated a level of dislike towards the object. Strange that he would talk down on the essence of a goliath&#39;s strength; after all, was it not from stone they themselves were carved? It was the rocks that gave the mountains form that gave way to the Goliaths, the people that would come to conquer them, to defend them, to call them their home even with all their perils. Advantages could easily be won or lost.

But still, a Goliath&#39;s choice was his own, and he had no reason nor want to chastise him for it. &quot;Indeed he has, and I would be honored to attend. Especially if it celebrates the carving of a life from the world slate.&quot; At Mors&#39; offer to join them in training battle, Uthal just smiled and replied, &quot;I have to come to this ship seeking to improve my skills. I hope to one day challenge the likes of wyrms and dragons, so yes, I will join you.&quot; It wasn&#39;t to show them he could fight, or how flashy his moves were; this was to see if they could challenge <em>him</em>. 

Though one noticeable difference was that Uthal did not have the same level of equipment that Mors did; merely a pair of cloth trousers and the giant hunk  of steel across his back that he called his weapon of choice were his worldly possessions. &quot;Where will this training take place?&quot; he then asked the pair. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">&quot;<span class="spoiler spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"><span class="spoiler-text">Good.</span></span>&quot; Mors said after Uthal accepted his invitation to the ceremony and observed the other Goliath while he explained the reason why he wanted more strength,  getting a little confused at the mention of &#39;wyrms and dragons&#39;. Somehow feeling that void inside his mind where pieces were still missing. Still he was smart enough to deduce that the other giant was speaking about powerful beasts. <em>Interesting...</em> He thought, maybe in the future he would join this one and see for himself how strong were these beasts but for now he needed to focus on more important things. 

He looked besides him at his elf and couldn&#39;t avoid the smile that formed on his lips once again. &quot;Yes little moon. Today we will train with the warrior you managed to find in the short time we were apart. How is that you keep convincing the fools around this place to do your bidding?&quot; He asked her. His voice sounding still evil to foreign ears but she would notice that he was trying to tease her and the now missing glow from under his armor being another indication of his lightening mood.

Then he turned his glowing eyes to Uthal before explaining. &quot;This place has a special room, where the warriors go to improve their skills, not only in single combat but tactics and survival. There&#39;s a big metal being that controls the room and create the battlefields. We will go there now and see what he manages to throw at us.&quot; So far Mors had noticed that each warrior of his kind he has met could fight, even the warden, but so far only his grandfather has proven to have a strategic mind similar to his own. 

He was going to become a father now, so it couldn&#39;t hurt to find other worthy warriors to become part of his kingdom when he decided to start expanding it in the future. These would be the first steps to achieve that, but before moving forward towards the training room, he looked at his mate and remembered something. &quot;We need to get your armor and bow before going there, little mate.&quot; He told her softly. </div>

It’s on the way to the training hall.” The girl spun once, her lacy skirt fanning out. She looked like some ethereal being, floating lightly on air amidst the sea of flowers. “I wonder if Mr Tower will notice this little addition,” she added happily, her hand moving to her belly. Already, she felt such a close bond to her son. “I suppose the warforged should get to know him. He’ll be a great warrior one day.” Her words were laced with love and pride. It was clear her unborn son already meant the world to her. “Shall we go then?” she prodded, giggling softly before she began to hum. The girl moved along the verdant grass, heading towards the door. Oh, she was elated that her Mors seemed so happy, that he was making friends with others. </div>

It had felt a little strange to only have his warhammer while he was conquering the jungle since he was used to go around carrying all his weapons but at the time his memories had not let him remember what was that he had been missing.

With little effort he picked the big weapon off the ground, using the same arm that was holding his shield. Just then he saw his elf starting to walk towards the door and heard his minions starting to do the same making him chuckle a little at the sight of the blue idiots obeying his mate without much effort.

&quot;You heard her. Time to move.&quot; Mors said to the other Goliath before starting to walk, easily catching up with her and wrapping his now free arms around her small shoulders. The blue minions running ahead of them while yelling nonsense to each other as they stepped outside the gardens and walked through the ship towards they room to get ready before moving to the <span class="mention">#training-hall</span> </div>

He wondered how she accomplished such a thing; Goliaths were ferocious competitors. To allow such sway would normally be deemed unthinkable, but perhaps this Irithriel was someone special to Mors? They were to be wed and even conceived a child together; that was no small matter to Goliaths. 

&quot;Very well. Let us see how this training area challenges us.&quot; he would say, following after the pair, hearing the strange jumbled mutterings of the small blue gremlins that followed alongside Mors and Irithriel; what were they, he did not know. But he was eager and ready to see what challenges would be thrown at him.

&quot;Do you two train often? Irithriel tells me she&#39;s conquered you twice, Mors; she must be a capable woman to handle you in that manner. You have my respect.&quot; he would then say out of the blue. </div>

And then she fought her way through my wild kingdom and made me remember.&quot; He answered without elaborating much.

&quot;We have only met the metal man challenges a couple of times before.... We have been... Away.&quot; Was the only thing he explained, not wanting to let his mind start to remember right now because he knew that it could trigger more of those annoying flashbacks and he wanted to be ready to meet the battle master&#39;s challenge.

“Oh, my beast!” Iri exclaimed happily. She all but danced deeper into the colorful display of fragrant blooms. “So much beauty. So much life.” The girl laughed, as she danced, leading her mate near a lovely bush blooming with a blue tinted hydrangea. “These are so exquisite, and the color! Oh, my beast!

Whateri it was now they could easily collect as many flowers as she wanted. &quot;Those don&#39;t even come closer to your beauty little moon... But they will do.&quot; He told her while gesturing towards the basket he had picked. &quot;Grab ad many as you want, I shall carry them for you.&quot; He would probably destroy the while bush in the process, one of the drawbacks of having big fingers but what he could easily do was being her pack mule.

The girl giggled softly and beelined towards the fragrant flowers she’d decided were perfect for their day. Oh, all the choices that surrounded them! She’d make their little ceremony beautiful, something lovely to share with the guild. Carefully, she began picking the large bundles of flowers from the bushes, placing them into the basket Mors held. The basket seemed to hum with strange nature magic, the ship’s way of preserving the pretty things the girl chose. 

“Oh, and these!” Iri exclaimed after adding several hydrangea bundles and then moving on to some peonies. She bent close to the pretty blooms, some pink, others yellow, the girl deciding both complemented the blue of the other flowers in the basket. “Mmm... like a spring garden,” she sighed, being reminded of her favorite places from her old, almost forgotten home. Though her home wasn’t filled with the best of memories, there were still a few she held dear. While picking a particularly vibrant yellow peony, a red fox leaped out onto the path. The pretty elf squealed in delight, pointing at it like an innocent little girl. “Look, my beast! Like my fox from back in the Feywild!” </div>

Not that he would care of anyone saw him smiling. Seeing her enjoy the gardens so much made him think that he should order the green minions to make one for her in their kingdom. 

The little assasins were very good with plants in general, they even made their small dwellings in the trees. They had even showed him some sort of drawings where they planned to make his stronghold but since he didn&#39;t want a wooden structure that could burn easily he had told them to stop and focused on training them to work properly as his army. 

&quot;Ah... Those were the small beats you told me about.&quot; He said while looking at the fox. &quot;We will have the green ones make a place like this in our kigdoms. If you wish, we can take these pets there too.&quot; He told her softly, not sure that these ones could survive the harsh jungle but maybe in a garden they could live and provide entertainment for his mate. </div>

He looked at the small beast following his mate and got a little surprised when the furball actually moved closer to them. &quot;It is a brave one.&quot; He declared since most small animals, could feel the danger of Mors prescence and ussually flew away from him. &quot;Yes little moon...

But she was soon brought back to the moment when the fox brushed up against her against, forcing her hand to pet his head. The girl laughed sweetly and turned her focus upon the creature. Glancing over at Mors, she moved to sit down on a tuft of grass beneath a lilac tree. 

The fragrant scent of the purple blooms filled the air, reminding the pretty elf of those happier moments from her past. It was almost as if the ship... knew. Not dwelling on that, the girl just let the fox approach, the animal curling up beside her and letting his head rest upon her lap. As if on cue, she then felt their son kick within her belly, immediately causing the girl to start. “Ohh...!” Iri exclaimed, her smile growing, eyes shining with pride. “Our son approves, my beast. I felt him. I felt him kick just now.”

The fox perked up his head, a paw brushing against her swollen belly, as if to say he was honored. Iri just pet the creature, her shadow magic suddenly swirling about her. She could feel it bending then, answering her, as it suddenly allowed her to hear the animal’s thoughts. “Sweet fox,” she said softly, the animal perking up, unblinking. “Yes,” she went on. “We can speak freely together from time to time.” The fox nuzzled closer for the girl, making sounds of delight, though Iri could now hear the words.

“I understand you, elf,” he rumbled out. “You can call me Fen.”

Iri squeaked happily. “Pleased to meet you, Fen.” She immediately looked over at Mors, indicating that she’d learned the creature’s name indeed! “I am Irithriel, though most call me Iri.” She scratched Fen’s ears, the fox seeming to enjoy the attention and affection very much. “Look, my beast! Look!” </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Mors followed after her. He not only wanted to see what she was going to do but also feel how she used those shadows to her advantage and then use that as a base for molding his new power.

He left the basket a little ways from them since he didn&#39;t want to accidentally destroy his mate&#39;s hard work even if she had a great time picking those flowers. Then he awkwardly sat under the small tree besides her. It would look very funny for anyone looking at them, the giant scary overlord sitting under a flower tree besides a small pretty elf and a fox but he didn&#39;t care. Each moment with her was unique and he enjoyed them.

&quot;Of course he does.&quot; He said with pride, it was his young after all. Ruling and gathering subjects was in his veins too.

Mors felt it then, the way shadows answered Irithriel&#39;s call and worked for her. <em>Interesting.</em> He thought, closing his eyes and focusing on the magic without losing track of what she was doing or saying. Not even power was more important than her.

He opened his eyes again and looked as she requested. &quot;I see, little moon...&quot; He chuckled a little since her joy was so contagious. &quot;So not only you can easily make others to follow you but also you can easily tame wild beasts too&quot; He reached with one big hand and caressed her cheek, &quot;You never stop showing me how amazing you are.&quot;

After a few moments he retrieved his hand and used both of them to touch the soft shadows casted by the tree. &quot;I know now what I will do. Be careful little elf, my power would never hurt you but still, be careful.&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">He gave her a small warning before closing his eyes and allowing his power to flow free. His markings suddenly lighted up, just like his eyes some were evil green and others were dangerous red. His evil aura too exploded from him, not really doing anything but filling the air with malevolence.

While he knew that those shadows would not easily listening to him, he was Mors. He had overcomed the natural rules of life and mere shadows would not stand against him. He would bend then with his iron will and force them to follow his dark wishes. <span class="spoiler spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"><span class="spoiler-text">&quot;I am Mors, and you darkness, are my new subject!&quot;</span></span> He roared in giant and opened his eyes, focused on the shadows. His power suddenly peaked and the red dissapeared from him while the green settled in a more darker, deeper tone. Strangely the glow of his eyes seemed more intense now.

And the shadows around them darkened and started to bend with each pulse of his power. </div>

But the girl merely pet the creature, her pretty face beaming, while watching her mate be exactly as she saw him—extraordinary! “See there, Fen,” she explained, still petting the fox. “This is the greatness of my mate. You’re under our care now. Nothing will harm you.” Fen perked up, looking at the overlord and giving him his own version of a nod. Iri knew immediately that this meant the animal had accepted them both and that made her all smiles knowing she had a little friend of her own. “Well done, my beast! I... I can feel your magic. My own seems to approve of how they share this space surrounding us.” Her face was glowing with love and pride. “It’s almost as if my magic knows...” At that, she leaned against Mors and sighed happily, her one hand caressing his thigh, while the other continued petting sweet Fen. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Mors smiled and looked at her, noticing how his vision had improved a lot and despite the darkness around them he could see perfectly. &quot;It is done. Now shadows obey me.&quot; He grumbled, the shadows making his voice echoe even more than normal.

With another pulse of his evil magic he turned the soft shadows of the tree around them into a magical darkness that no common sight could penetrate. &quot;I am their master now and can make them follow my wishes.&quot; It left Irithriel and the fox completely devoid of light, only Mors could see through them.

He raised his hands from the ground and pulled Irithriel sideways into his lap. He grabbed the fox too and lowered into hers so she could keep petting it without straining herself and he could feel his mate&#39;s body against his big chest. &quot;Now I am not only stronger but no power is compatible with yours.&quot; He growled softly in her ear and kissed her neck a couple of times. &quot;I can bend them to my will and they can no longer hide anything from me or mine.&quot; He bit her then, in that special spot he always liked to mark. Only this time he pushed some of his power into her, to share with her some of his new adquired power. 

Like always, the dark and malevolent power was harmless to her but this time it did something new. Not only allowed her to see through this magical darkness but also it improved her already natural darkvision so much that now not even the shadows of his helmet could hide his face from her.

&quot;As long as you are near I can boost you little moon. Now even shadows are our subjects.&quot; He said softly while looking into her eyes and leaned in to kiss her properly this time. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">The complete and utter darkness only last for a moment. One minute, Irithriel could see nothing, the next, she was safe in her Mors’ arms, nothing hidden from view. She nuzzled her mate lovingly, groaning softly when he bit down upon her slim shoulder. Meanwhile, Fen seemed content in Iri’s lap, accepting this strange magic enveloping them all, while under the pretty tree. 

“Mm... thank you, my beast,” Iri sighed, turning slightly so that she straddled Mors’ lap. Fen just curled up beside the overlord, eyes closed, while he relaxed near the pair. “There’s nothing that we cannot do together,” she went on, smiling brightly at the only man she could ever love like this. “Together we will have the best family and the best home.”

Iri felt her face flush slightly. Still smiling, she slowly leaned forward to give Mors a kiss. Shame he donned his helmet, but she wouldn’t let it stop her despite it. Pulling away, she just giggled softly. So happy and proud of this man that would soon be her husband, was destined to be her mate, and was the father of their unborn son. Life had been cruel. But it had also gifted her the most miraculous thing it ever could. </div>

Now without anything to bother them Mors grabbed the back of Iri&#39;s head and pulled her in for a savage kiss. He didn&#39;t have to worry about his power exploding in fury and fire anymore since he had molded it to darkness instead. So he kissed her hard, deep, like he had wanted to do in the baths. &quot;Together... Even darkness has to bend to our will...&quot; He growled between kisses. 

After a while Mors finally released her so she could breathe and he made the mistake to lean back against the small tree.

<strong>Crack...</strong>

The sound made Mors lean forward quickly, to take his weight out of the small tree trunk. &quot;Puny tree...&quot; Mors grumbled but then chuckled a little. &quot;Maybe the green ones can make them grow stronger... We only passed through but do you remember how they made their dwellings within the trees?&quot; He asked her softly after finishing moving forward and starting to nuzzle her neck. </div>

Meanwhile, Irithriel continued straddling Mors, her lips furiously moving over his, while they kissed passionately beneath the pretty lilac tree. 

The pair just kissed for several moments, the act so intimate, causing the air to heat up just a little bit. When Iri pulled back, she could feel her heart racing, her lungs on fire, as she made to catch her breath. The girl smiled then, watching her mate adjust and get comfortable when...

The sound of the tree cracking caused Fen to perk up, his eyes wide and watchful, looking for signs of impending danger. But, he soon heard Iri’s giggled, along with Mors’ grumbles and soon went back to resting quietly once more. 

“Oh yes,” Iri stated. “I remember those little treehouses!” The girl nodded then, sighing softly when Mors moved to nuzzle her. “I would love if they could improve the gardens. Would they do it, my beast? It would make me so happy. Just think of all the trees our son could climb!” At that, she brought a hand down to her belly and caressed it. “You know, we need to figure out his name. Have you thought on any?” </div>

No matter what she wished he knew his minions will work to accomplish it. &quot;The blue ones could make structures from coral and giant seashells... Not the two little shits bit the others, the ones that were butchered.&quot; He had his face still pushed against her neck. He would never stop enjoying everything about her.

Then after nibbling on her a little more he pulled back and looked down at her swollen belly, one of his big hands landed on top of hers. &quot;I have not. Our son needs a strong name, a unique one... One that has never been heard before... What about Tors?&quot; He asked while still looking at her belly. He wouldn&#39;t mind if she didn&#39;t like it. It was just the first name that came to him. The only thing he wanted was a name that would not be a copy from another because just like them, all of their children would live by their own rules, not held back by foolish society.... After they reached maturity of course, while they were still young they would live like their parents wanted them too because one thing he would never allow was for them to end up like the two dumb minions, doing whatever they wanted and making life hard for him. Even if those shenanigans ended up leading him into meeting his wonderful mate. </div>

She sighed softly, molding herself against him, while she enjoyed the way he kissed and nibbled at her flesh. “Hrmm... perhaps we should make a list?” she suggested, smiling at him. “I have one for it. Aeran.” Her hands moved up to Mors’ face, delicate fingers combing through his hair and fussing over his beard. “It... it’s one I made up,” she admitted. “It... it is elvish,” she went on, hoping that was all right. “But it’s my own combination of the words king and the sea.” Her face then darkened into a pretty blush, and she bit down on her lower lip for a moment. “King because he is of his father. Sea because it gave his father this new life and brought him to me.” She felt silly explaining it aloud, but she hoped her mate understood. “If you don’t like it, my beast, it doesn’t have to go on our list.” At that, she leaned close and placed her sweet lips against his own. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="24-Jun-20 07:11 AM">(edited)</span></div>

You... you like it that much?” she squeaked, absolutely delighted. She found it endearing, as he tested out the name, the word awkward when it rolled along his tongue. But watching him do this, accept everything she gave... she wondered if he truly understood how deeply this touched her soul. 

“We will make sure you can say it properly by the time Aeran arrives,” Iri stated with a nod. Her heart swelling with love when Mors spoke in his native language, their foreheads touching, their lips so close. “He’s a lucky little boy,” she went on. “He has the most wonderful father.” She leaned in then, her lips touching his. Sighing softly, she felt her body start to respond to her mate, her sex growing hotter, while she straddled him, her little whimpers reaching his ears. 

Fen hadn’t moved a muscle, the fox quite happy in his little ‘house’ for the moment. Utterly relaxed and happy, the creature had managed to just fall asleep. His body rose and fell with each breath, his head resting against his front paws. </div>

Instead of falling in with her and surrendering to what they both needed, he pulled back, panting a little. &quot;The flowers... We need to get them to the green minions... They shall take care of everything.&quot; No matter how hard his cock was, he would not let all her hard work go to waste.

He kissed her neck a couple more times before finally pulling back, reaching for his helmet and easily putting it on. As soon as the metal piece was on his head, the magical darkness retreated inside him and his marks stopped glowing.

With a small groan of frustration he carefully grabbed her hips and moved her off him so he could get out from under the small tree and pick up the basket. &quot;Come little moon. Time to go back to our room and bring the pet if you wish.&quot; He grumbled, offering her his free hand. </div>

Besides, she didn’t want others watching them should anything happen anyway. So, she composed herself, her hands grasping at her lacy skirt, and began moving back through the gardens. She watched her mate pick up the basket, along with his helmet, Fen perking up and moving to be beside her. 

“You wish to come with us, Fen?” Iri asked of the fox. The creature nodded, nuzzling affectionately against her leg. “Well, then it’s settled. You are ours now. Our room is yours. We’ll see to it that you have a corner all your own.” Fen pranced around showing his gratitude, as well as his excitement. 

“Let’s go, my beast,” Iri hummed. At that, she skipped out into the corridor, Fen close behind. She didn’t stop until reaching the door of their room. (Exit fo <span class="mention">#mors-and-irithriels-room</span> ). </div>

He was honestly beginning to not like this world too much. <em>But</em> he&#39;d chosen to give up his forward progress into the multiverse, seeing as his destination would never be found, long before he&#39;d heard of this disgusting abuse of power. 
At least Jonny was a good man, as far as the wizard could tell. He was friendly, handsome, a good sport, and an <em>amazing</em> fuck. Of course, the latter was less important than any of the former, but it was a nice bonus. </div>

&quot;It seems we&#39;re a bit more similar than I thought,&quot; the tabaxi says. He looks at the plant a bit longer before nodding to himself, and casts a tiny flowerpot into existence to place it inside. He explains what he meant by it. &quot;I have a large family, but my mother was the only one I really spent time with. The career I chose was in an effort to bring me and my family out of poverty. The fact that I enjoyed it was simply a bonus. I&#39;m sorry you had nobody. It&#39;s hard to be alone.&quot; </div>

It wasn&#39;t quite so bloody, but there were multiple instances where a fellow student stole my research after a one night stand, and I was left with nothing to present. Finals week will leave one vulnerable in a competitive environment. I was very glad to learn that things were more relaxed after earning my place among Althea&#39;s Wards. You have nothing else to prove once you&#39;re named one of Her Children.&quot; 
Tomara lifts up the flower for Jonny to see it in a better light. &quot;This is similar to a flower from my world known as The Moon&#39;s Eye. Mythos behind the name is complicated, but it had properties making incredibly valuable to seers. The best thing about it was that you needn&#39;t kill it to make it work for you. My mother kept the flower that told her that her and my father would be married. It was her most prized possession.&quot; </div>

Walking into the forested area of the gardens he finds his favorite tree. At the edge of a pond with vines and other appendages hanging over it. Not too far was a patch of tall grass that already looked it was claimed by something before. As soon as the 4 reached their areas then dispersed. Bary went to the pond to start his swimming and hunting for small fish. Phantom went to his patch of grass and Groot climbed his way into the canopy. Warden took his spot at the base of the tree. Removing his gear he sets it to the side and sits down. Takes a deep breath and starts his commune with nature to help him relax.</em> </div>

What did the humans call it? Cool? He still didn&#39;t understand how a reference of heat deficiency could be used to describe splendor, but...It seemed to fit the situation. It was indeed cool. He walked on and on, two big fresh boar femurs under his arm and a decently sized bundle of the silk from the Cave Fisher he defeated on his hunt. 

However, he was soon to encounter Warden, seeing the fellow Goliath meditate. &quot;Warden. Fortuitous I find you here.&quot; Uthal would say, coming close to the Goliath but still keeping a respectful distance. He noticed the new companions, commenting &quot;Seems you have made some new friends. Hopefully Phantom is not jealous of the attention. Speaking of which...&quot; He would then hold up not one, but <em>two</em> juicy deliciously-thick femur bones. &quot;I believe you said he likes the femurs of Giant Boars yes? Worry not, these bones have not been cooked. I was careful in that regard.&quot; </div>

Holding up the bundle of silk-like material, he then asked, &quot;I&#39;m afraid this type of material is something I&#39;m not entirely familiar with. I figured a fresh set of eyes could be useful. This seems like spider&#39;s silk, but I obtained it from a much larger creature. I had not fought anything like it before. It was large and vicious, and it tried to ensnare me with this. I wish you could have been there to see the battle; it was invigorating!&quot; 

He said that last part a bit more loudly, recalling his fight with the creature. Giving a slight cough he then said, &quot;But in any case...I had come to seek your opinion on this material. Do you know anything of it?&quot; </div>

The fact that it was such a renowned beast made Uthal even prouder of himself for killing it. 

&quot;You weave?&quot; Uthal asked, his prideful look changing to one of surprise by the revelation. &quot;Apologies, I hadn&#39;t taken you for the weaving sort with your skill in combat and tracking. But yes, either sell or trade. If you like, stone brother, I can provide it to you for either goods or coin.&quot; He had limited dealings in coin purchases, so he tried to come with a reasonable price. &quot;How does either 50 gold or an item of equal worth sound for a price?&quot; he then asked the Warden. </div>
