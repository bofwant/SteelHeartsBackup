Why she’d let them see her, she didn’t know. That was a lie. She did. Her emotions had gotten the better of her. Chattering, terrified, she longed for the ship to miraculously move.

She tugged on her hood, trying to pull it tighter about her head, when a gust blew through the deck and pushed it back, her shockingly white hair whipping about her face. Her pale eyes watered and she reached to pull the hood back up. There were so many people milling about, all of them so very strange. She eyed each one, silently daring herself to to say hello, but... each and every time, she held herself back. 

Suddenly, there was a loud crash, the sound of something heavy striking wood. Rose turned and saw a strange monster, her eyes going wide, before she let out a blood curdling scream. She hadn’t meant to draw that kind of attention and immediately scowled. Not wanting the monster to eat her she bolted towards the nearest door, her tiny fists banging against it. “Monster! Monster!” she shouted, white hair blowing, wild and knotted from the wind, utterly terrified she’d end up much like her mentor. </div>

The pickings had been slim so far.  These people were desperate to cross the ice and if there was a rich one he wasnt leaving his cabin, leaving the economy class the leisure about.  Of course the thefts would be noticed but by then the ship had bigger problems.  Hed be in a galley with the rest of them.  

Much of the ship was below deck in the bunk quarters.  The first mate had told everyone that to concerve coal, most of the furnaces here would be stoked, and hot soup would he served with mulled cider and hot tea.  It worked winders to keep out the chill. </div>

Tumbler would be served such a repaste and had for the most part been left to his own devices.  He might notice however that there were barely eight people in this room when there was much more on the ship, probably too scared to leave their cabins. </div>

Rose had stowed herself above on the top deck in the storage room before ones go below deck, using barrels and crates as her crying corner.

Her scream would be heard by everyone.

The banging on the galley would cause the first mate to rush to the door.  There shed see the shark man at the top of the stairs behind the screaming winter Eladrin!

&quot;Pirates!&quot;  She called into the room as the door was shut and locked behind Rose.

Garg would see where he would need to go, only a heavy door in his way between him and the crew and their sweet sweet fear. </div>

Despite the warm clothes, and the furnace, Alex still felt rather cold, especially after giving his warmest set of clothing away to someone who seemed like he needed it way more than the white haired man, so for now he tried to keep himself as warm as possible

After a while of waiting by the furnaces, he heard a loud shriek coming from the top deck, sending a shiver down on his spine. What happened? What was wrong? There wasn&#39;t too much time to think about it, since somebody could have been in danger

After waiting for a couple of seconds to see if anyone would leave the cozy part of the ship, just to check the source of the scream out, Alex quickly stood up, and started walking towards the source of the earlier scream, secretly holding his dagger with his right hand underneath his clothing, making it concealed, yet easy to pull out </div>

Her life had been in danger ever since that day she’d watched the poachers slaughter her mentor. And all because he’d stood up for what he’d believed. The eladrin had always thought him to be right to worry about them. But she’d never expected them to go so far. And now she was their next target. 

Her worries about poachers forgotten, Rose had never seen such a monster before in her life. She didn’t think anyone would answer her cries. Her own family had cast her out when she’d begged for help. So why would strangers dare to bother. But the door opened. Rose turned around, the sight of teeth forever etched into her mind. Again, she screamed, though she was yanked inside, the door closing just as the monster was about to reach where she stood. 

As the door shut, Rose felt a wave of relief wash over her. But those loud banging noises echoed throughout the ship. Rose knew that monster was out there, and probably with more of his kind. What was he? Trembling with fear and hating herself for it, she backed away from the door. Her hand grabbed a hold of her scimitar, slim fingers curled about the handle. “Pirates? Monsters?” she squeaked. Oh if only the ship would start moving again. Why oh why had her luck taken a turn for the worst? </div>

Panic flooded her and she began to imagine her mentor... his pleas, his shouts, that messy squish when the poachers mutilated his body. “No... no...” she muttered, her hot breath visible in the frigid cold air. She was too frightened to engage in conversation. “That... that thing...” Her body was visibly shaking, her focus on how to survive. “It’ll kill us...” All she could remember were those ominous teeth. Teeth that looked sharp, meant to shred and to kill. 

Suddenly, the door fell down with a thud. Rose’s eyes widened, she glanced at the others around her, her pale eyes then settling on that creature looming in the doorway. A blast of cold kissed the winter eladrin’s face, the girl gasping, terror closing in all around when she let out another shrieking scream. Frightened and shaking, she tried to move through the sea of people suddenly barring the way. </div>

He scowled, &quot;The fuck is wrong with ya!

The eladrin glanced over her shoulder, the shark monster still shouting and making noise. She’d heard gun shots, her keen eyes taking in the fact that he was injured. Maybe... just maybe... Turning on her heels, she faced the monster’s direction, a hand plunging into her pouch, while the other gracefully waved in the air. “<span class="spoiler spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"><span class="spoiler-text">Stay still...</span></span>” she mumbled in Druidic, her eyes clamping shut, while she envisioned this creature unable to move, immobilized by invisible bonds, holding him fast despite any struggles. It took all her concentration to keep him still, but she decided to use this as their one chance to attempt reason. 

“You big bully!” Rose shouted, her pale cheeks turning red, as she angrily stomped her foot. She then held up her hand to try and hold off the others from reacting too quickly. Perhaps this bully could be reasoned with? Studying the situation further, she suddenly realized the monster was just one. Alone. “Wait! He’s alone,” she added. “He’s no threat!” Again, she stomped her foot and stormed back towards the front of the galley, her concentration still holding. Looking straight at the shark man, she scowled, pale eyes narrowing. “You’re a big meanie and owe everyone here an apology for scaring them.” With a huff, she placed her hands on her hips and waited. After all, this monster wasn’t going anywhere. Not any more. </div>

Cheeks puffed and red, Rose’s lip jutting out, she sneered at the monster. “Bully scaring me like that...” she grumbled, pulling her hood up over her head to stay warm. “I don’t understand people... ugh...” She looked to the captain then, waiting for the ‘ok’ that she could finally release this shark monster and give him a piece of her mind. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="19-Oct-19 09:25 PM">(edited)</span></div>

It was a painful way to go. “<span class="spoiler spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"><span class="spoiler-text">Heal...</span></span>” she muttered in Druidic, figuring a little help might go a long way. She watched the bleeding stop, which was far better than what it had been doing. 

Heaving a sigh and pushing back her hood, Rose eyed the shark man. Again her hands went to her hips. “You!” she shouted. “Are a bully!” Her pretty face contorted, as she tried to find the right words. “A big meanie and... and... ugh!” She was shaking, both from anger and the lingering bit of fear this beast had caused her. It didn’t help that she was running for her life. “What do you gain from scaring everyone?” Blind with raging fury, she poked the shark man on his uninjured side, confident the ropes would hold him. </div>

Without even thinking, the girl’s hand flew through the air, landing on the side of what was this creature’s face. Her open palm struck him hard with a loud slap, the bite of the cold causing it to sting once she’d made contact. Refusing to admit she felt pain, she merely hid her hurting hand and scowled. “Never heard of you, you great big ass!” she shouted, eyes just starting to water. “You apologize to everyone!” she then demanded, stomping her foot, her uninjured hand balled into a tiny shaking fist at her side. This... Garg... was the biggest jerk in her opinion. She’d dealt with some horrible people before, but this? Ugh! She’d never give this one the time of day. Not ever. “Hmph!” </div>

There was a loud whining sound—wood creaking against ice, perhaps? It was anyone’s guess and without proper investigation, it would remain as much. But she also distinctly heard a loud thump, the vibrations having moved through the ship, causing her body to both feel it and hear it. “What the...” she mumbled, confused. 

As Rose shook her head, frowning a bit, she then heard what sounded like singing. Was this magic or more boarders? Ugh! She couldn’t take another want-to-be pirate right then. Not when everyone was already dealing with Garg. “Does anyone hear that?” she then asked of anyone who might be listening as well—including Garg. She scowled then and gave the shark man’s tail a final kick. “Hmph.” It was clear she was still fairly upset with his earlier antics </div>

In other words, he didn’t stand a chance. Rolling her eyes, she relaxed a bit and ran her uninjured hand through her wild snowy hair. “Don’t let the brute frighten you,” she huffed, ignoring the fact that she herself had been terrified earlier... before she’d realized he was acting on his own. Again, she kicked Garg’s tail. “By the way, my name is Rosewynn. Call me Rose,” she said, trying to sound confident though she felt anything but. “This big meanie owes us all an apology.

                    <div class="markdown">Something was wrong and Rose didn’t like it. Was something outside? Could there be anything worse than those poachers? For a moment, the eladrin froze where she stood, memories of her mentor’s murder, the way those men glared at her flooding her thoughts. Her teeth began to chatter, her uninjured hand reaching for the scimitar on her hip. 

“Where did everyone go... something feels off... the singing... it stopped?” The girl looked at the bound shark man and the couple others that seemed to possibly be as startled as she was. “I’m going to regret this,” Rose then muttered under her breath. 

Moving to the shark man, Rose poked him in the chest and whispered harshly. “Not sure if you heard that, but something doesn’t feel right.” She paused, looking back at the others and closed her eyes. By the Nine Hells, she must be crazy! Eyes snapping open, her nimble fingers went to work on the ropes. They were already quite loose, no doubt the beast was close to breaking free. 

“Don’t make me sorry I did this,” Rose said to Garg, her eyes avoiding his. When she finished untying him, she jumped back, terrified he’d do something, hurt someone. “Something is out there,” she snapped, hoping the monster would see reason. “We need everyone. Everyone.” It was a plea for help, her cheeks turning a rosy red. “So help. Please.” It was a demand, but that hopeful plea in her voice could not be mistaken. </div>

It wasn&#39;t really a <em>person</em>. Blindness/Deafness? Might be useful. She held her forehead. &quot;If it was a called we might not have a choice but to kill it ourselves.&quot; she mentioned, to then blow air into her hands to try to warm up.

And all she wanted to do here was to get to the first mate. Why did it all have to go to shit. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="22-Oct-19 12:32 PM">(edited)</span></div>

                    <div class="markdown">Rose arched a brow, her hand back on the handle of her scimitar once again. She bit down on her lower lip, a bit leery to just bolt outside like the shark man. There was no way she’d follow that ungrateful brute. What did that monster care about anyone else on that ship? He’d probably never lost anyone before... suddenly, the girl’s heart lurched and she could see his face as clear as day in her mind. Horace. Her mentor. Her friend. 

Not knowing what the others milling about were going to do, she gave each a nod. “I’m not just going out there,” Rose said softly. She looked for a way to peek outside to gain her bearings on just what it was that was happening. </div>

The eladrin gasped at the sight, watching the shark man rant and rave and run about. But she noticed he wasn’t merely shouting. No. There was direction in his voice. He was addressing something or someone. But who? Just then, she saw the tentacles, large and writhing. They were gripping the boat, squeezing. Crushing. Yet Garg did... nothing? Something wasn’t right. 

“Who are you shouting at?” Rose yelled from the doorway. The cold air stung, making her pretty face turn red from the cold. “The creature will tear this boat apart! We must stop it or we all die!” she went on, hoping this monster would see reason. That, or explain all his yelling. She then glanced beyond the ship, but all she could see was a sea of white. Ice and snow. A ship stuck fast, though now in the clutches of something lurking beneath. 

“Please!” Rose suddenly found herself begging. “We need to do something before we end up crushed or drowned! Or... frozen!” The girl gulped, not wanting to die like this. Not wanting to die at all. Those poachers were still out there. And they’d never rest until she was dead, much like Horace. </div>

“Controlled?” Rose asked, but then suddenly she gasped, her thoughts spinning. Maybe that’s what the singing was for? “Maybe it was the singing!” she then shouted in suggestion, the only thing that seemed to fit. But where were these singers? If only she knew more about the sea... With a scowl, she stepped out onto the deck, angry that this bully was actually right. No one else seemed fazed by what was happening, but she had no intentions of dying. 

Rose then looked to where Garg had mentioned. She then nodded, deciding the shark man would get another slap later after they managed to get out of this. “Of all the insufferable... boorish...” she grumbled, as she began heading towards the indicated tracks and the cargo hold. </div>

The door opened, Gargs would recognize the underbelly of a ship, the barrels and crates ready to be torn open for their contents of hard tack and coal.  This was merely the top of the deck, stairs were going down into the lower holds.  The dragging of the snow stopped some four or five feet from the door when the snow was tracked in.  

Among the other bits and bobs in the room, a rather sturdy looking steam trunk lay nestled between two crates by the stairs. </div>

As she sucked in harsh breaths, she backed away from the trunk, scrambling on the floor.

Just how was she and this brute of a shark man supposed to save a ship all on their own. <em>Cowards! The lot of them! This is why Horace hates people!</em> The girl’s eyes watered and she reached for her scimitar, slashing at that persistent crab. Furious and deciding this was a battle they could not win, she glowered at the little beastie, her face taking on an eerie sort of look. She started to mumble then. “<span class="spoiler spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"><span class="spoiler-text">To the exit...</span></span>” she said in elvish. At that, she seemed to shimmer into a strange sort of mist, her tiny form disappearing, only to rematerialize near the exit. “Garg!” she shouted, though she didn’t know why.

                    <div class="markdown">Rose frowned, her body aching. She was bleeding and definitely needed some medical attention. But there wasn’t time. Not yet. So she pressed on and moved outside. She heard Garg’s shouts, that insufferable shark man making her blood boil. He was fortunate that she wasn’t feeling well, that they were on the run—something she was all too familiar with—as it was the only thing saving him from a slap across the face. Again. 

“I... I don’t know,” Rose mumbled. She was upset that no one chose to actually do something to save the ship... and all their lives. It just wasn’t something she understood. What was more, it bothered her that the only one brave enough to action was... the bully of a monster. She scowled then, despite her pain. 

“Last I saw them, they were down below in the kitchens. They all just stayed.” Rose’s pretty face contorted, another spike of anger bubbling up. As she moved across the deck, she noticed the strange sea magic dissipate. But she could still hear the laughter of that witch. Whatever those things were... she had a feeling this wouldn’t be the last they saw of them. She turned towards Garg then, the faint sound of voices echoing from... somewhere. The eladrin tilted her head, white hair falling in front of her pretty face. She pushed it away, groaning softly from the pain. “Did... did you hear that?” she asked of Grag, wondering if he’d heard those strange voices too. </div>

It doesnt take him long to find the girl.  A door doesnt close all the way and there is the sound of struggling to do so, but as he approaches, she squeaks and backs away from the door with a fright.

Approaching her, there is nothing in the room save a big bed, a dresser, clothing bags, cases, and everything that would suggest parents... yet where were they?  

Another mystery.  What parents would leave a child behind? </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Rose scowled, her hands balled up into tiny fists. She was shaking with anger and from the cold. It didn’t help that her entire body ached, ready to collapse. But she couldn’t. Not yet. Not now. She needed to get off the ship, find somewhere safe—if that was even possible any longer. 

“I refuse to die!” Rose shouted, desperately trying to hide her injuries. She didn’t want Garg to know. He’d insulted her enough and she was quite done with that. “I’m getting off this thing, while I can.” She thought on the poachers. They were still out there. Tracking. Trailing. “It’s not safe and it’s not going anywhere anytime soon save down into those icy waters.” She shivered, as the wind howled, whipping her white hair across her pale face. “No thank you!”

Rose began heading for the edge of the ship when she noticed the man from the kitchens. Alex? She was sure that’s what he’d called himself. He was dragging a little girl along with him. Oh, as if it couldn’t get any worse. The eladrin was battered and bruised, clearly bleeding. “We cannot save this ship!” she exclaimed, knowing she also couldn’t stay put. The poachers would find her. Torture her. Murder her. No! “We either stay and die or leave and increase our odds. I’m off this thing!”

Without further hesitation, Rose leaped over the ship’s edge and climbed down onto the ice, eager to get away. Eager to find safety and protection. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="27-Oct-19 08:19 PM">(edited)</span></div>

She tried to scream, but her voice just would not come. Her pale eyes wide, she saw movement under the water, glimpsing what she knew to be... sirens. As fear filled her heart, she felt her already injured body ache, her arms and legs suddenly so very heavy. Tired. She tried desperately to move them and swim, but it proved too difficult and she began to sink. Panic swelled, yet her body refused to move, to act. Just then, she felt something grab hold of her and she was suddenly able to breathe once more. 

The wind was cold, Rose’s tiny body shivering in Garg’s arms. She needed heat. Warmth. The nearest source... that bloody ship and it’s furnaces. The eladrin tried to look up at Garg, her body defying her mind. “Furnaces...” she rasped, her voice soft. Fading. Her lips were bluer than usual, her skin going from pale to purple. She needed the warm and fast! Her clothes were wet and cold, her little body shaking. The girl looked up at Garg, a bit dazed that he bothered to save her. It was probably because he needed something from her... “C-cold...” she then whispered through chattering teeth. “S-so very c-cold...” </div>

                    <div class="markdown">For what felt like an eternity, but had only been a brief few moments, Rose felt her vision fade in and out of blackness. Her body was pressed against someone or something that felt cold. Shaking, her eyes snapped open and she realized she was being held by... Garg? Her mind began to race, her thoughts a blur—yes, she’d jumped into the water, saw that... siren... and then was pulled to safety by the shark man. She still wasn’t sure why he did it, but she was grateful. And she hated feeling that way towards someone who’d been an insufferable prat since the moment they’d met. 

“I c-cannot stay out here,” Rose managed to say, her mouth dry and her throat hoarse. “T-to c-cold. I need t-to remove my wet things and g-get dry. W-warm.” Her pale skin had a light purple tint now, her muscles tired and heavy, her body aching and bleeding. At that, the eladrin wriggled free of Garg’s hold and began climbing back on board the ship. Against her better judgment—though perhaps it was because she felt she now owed him one—she glanced over her shoulder back at the shark man. “Y-your first mate needs help,” she said. “L-lets see if we c-can get your b-boat b-back.” It was the best she could do even if she knew there was no way to commandeer the thing. Not now. Not when the sirens had control. And they did. </div>

Her pale eyes saw the door that led to the kitchens, which meant it also led to the furnaces. She scowled then knowing what she’d have to do for the sake of survival. Why oh why was she so modest? Before heading to the door, she turned to see if Garg followed, her tiny body shaking violently from the cold. She then looked at Alex and the child, half dazed and still bothered that almost no one seemed to understand the dire situation they all were in. This was a battle none of them could win. This was a battle of wit and diplomacy. She thought of Horace then, her reclusive life. The poachers. It was a pity she sorely lacked in this area entirely. </div>

The eladrin turned towards Garg then, her eyes noting the large tentacle gripping the ship... squeezing. Gone was the monster who’d saved her down in the water and back was the beast and that anger to match. “H-he’s a h-healer...” she said to Garg, while gesturing towards Alex. Her arms then moved about her slight body, a type of hug to stave off the chill. “H-his magic h-healed me. B-but I need to g-get inside or I’ll d-die,” she explained, not saying any more and merely moving towards the door.

Rose didn’t have time for conversation. Yet. Though she hoped the look she gave both Garg and Alex was enough to let them all know they needed to talk. And soon. But she couldn’t wait. She needed out of her wet things if she wanted a chance at life. To get dry and warm and find the ship’s people. But she did need to explain what she’d seen under the water just before she’d blacked out and Garg saved her first. This was truly a battle they couldn’t win. They needed to understand. Some powers and magic were just untouchable by most and it needed to be accepted if anyone wished to survive. 

Rose made her way through the galley towards the end of the kitchens. When she saw the furnaces, she sighed. The ship was groaning and the girl knew it was that kraken crushing the ship. But she had time. She just needed to use it wisely. The girl peeled off her clothes, cold and wet from before. She packed them up and put everything in her pack. In nothing but her underwear, she reached for a blanket and wrapped it about herself, desperate to finally get warm. </div>

She heard the loud crashes and knew that could only mean one thing. The eladrin turned her head and immediately caught sight of Garg. She rolled her eyes and sighed. “Hmph... some of us don’t want to die!” she shouted. “You honestly think I want to be in this state?” The girl stood up then, clearly wearing almost nothing underneath the blanket wrapped about her lithe body. 

“But enough of this ridiculous arguing,” Rose sighed in exasperation. “We need to get to the bottom of the boat. Fast.” She secured the blanket about her body and put back on her armor at least to help keep it place. She then put her pack back on her back. “Haven’t you noticed that the crew is missing? The passengers?” She paused a moment and puffed. “The voices. The sirens. They want to go to them.” She placed her hands on her hips. It was obvious the girl was tired and frightened. But it was also obvious she wouldn’t stop until safety could be found. 

“Look,” Rose continued. “I recognized those sirens. They won’t stop. We can’t win this. But... but we can at least live.” The girl bit down on her lip. “They’ll need someone. Someone willing,” she said, her words slow, as if she was still trying to process the situation. “If they get what they want, they might just call off that kraken and... and let us go.” </div>

Though she had a terrible headache, she could now manage at least. If only she had clothes instead of the blanket. With a blush on her cheeks, she finally reached the door and opened it. There hadn’t been any other ways to get down below. But she decided that must be where everyone had gone. No doubt the sirens’ lure was beckoning the get close. Perhaps one of them would be willing to go for the sake of everyone? She could only hope. This couldn’t work if consent wasn’t given. She glanced back at Garg and sighed. “You cannot just throw anyone overboard,” she said softly, almost stoic. “They must be willing. I only hope one will be enough.” </div>

                    <div class="markdown">A strange pain tugged at Rose’s heart. A part of her hated herself for being willing to move forward with such a trade, but... those sirens needed <em>willing</em>. Even if she were to go instead of Amelia, those sirens would know her heart, would know she didn’t want to do it. And that would be enough for such an exchange not to work. 

“Exactly like Saint Krismas Day. Do you know what you’d like your day to be called? On your day we will exchange something precious and meaningful with another. We will light candles and lanterns and set them on the water. Like little fairy lights illuminating the path to those who remember. So you won’t feel alone. Your day, Amelia.” 

Rose’s voice faltered slightly, so she paused and cleared her throat. She noticed the girl clutching an egg. “Would you like one of us to take your egg for you?” she then asked. “We can do so, if you’d prefer it. Your choice,” she said reassuringly. The eladrin then looked to both Garg and Alex. “We need to get below deck. I’m certain that’s where we need to go. Perhaps if we try talking to the sirens they will listen back especially when little Amelia wishes to give them something so very precious. The first celebration of her holiday.” <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="30-Oct-19 08:04 AM">(edited)</span></div>

                    <div class="markdown">Rose turned towards Garg the moment he mentioned he could speak to the sirens. Was he like her and able to speak with animals? Or was it something else? Perhaps it was because they were all aquatic. “You’d speak to them?” she asked. “And let them know we have someone willing to go along with them? Perhaps let them know it’s a human child and if they could provide us a means for her to join them safely. They won’t want her harmed.”

A shiver ran along Rose’s spine and she tugged at the blanket wrapped about her almost naked body. She adjusted her pack and then looked to Amelia again. “You’ll be treated well. Like a princess,” she said reassuringly. It did ease her heart knowing that the little girl would indeed want for nothing. But it still stung that she’d be giving up the life she knew, leaving her parents... forever. “You’d like that I am sure,” she added. “But we’d better get below. It’ll be easier to speak to them from there.”

Rose looked at Garg. “If you need me to speak to them too, I will be able. But I need to be closer to them to do so. So let’s head down. Please try reaching out to them on the way.” At that, she gestured for Garg, Alex and Amelia to follow. Perhaps Amelia could glimpse her parents one last time. It was the least they could do given the situation. </div>

She then looks at the egg in her hand and offers it to them to one.  &quot;Here.  This is Pox&#39;s baby.  She asked me to take care of it while she went on an adventure.   I promised to protect her.  Can you do that?  She said she&#39;d meet me in Erie once her quest was done.  Can you find her for me?

If they need to get somewhere, we’ll find a way to help them. I promise.” The eladrin smiled, though she felt utterly rotten inside.

Human affairs... this was why her family shunned her, had refused sanctuary or aid. Rose couldn’t help herself. Maybe it was the influence of her old mentor. Or maybe it was something else. But this was something she needed to see through and would despite the fact that it involved humans. At least these humans showed integrity, bravery, loyalty. So different from those poachers. 

In that moment, Rose flinched. She remembered the time Horace had found her bleeding out and close to death. She’d been hunting, a storm on its way. Horace had been expecting her, but she was late. When the man had found her, her little body had been caught in a trap meant for a bear. She couldn’t feel her body after a while, the pain so intense she felt numb. Her back hadn’t been the same after that, nor her outlook on humans. Especially poachers. She’d been lucky Horace had gone looking for her...

Blinking, Rose turned towards Garg and glanced at Alex, who’d seemed rather quiet. “Below it is,” she said and began leading Amelia by the hand. The blanket she donned felt rough, but it was dry and warm. Now that they were no longer in imminent danger, she’d have to properly dry her clothes. It was rather embarrassing to be dressed as she was. But it was certainly safer. “I’m very proud of you,” she went on, as they headed down below deck. </div>

He know that it was a really brave thing for her to do, and even he was really proud of the girl who signed up for it, but... Why couldn&#39;t he get himself to choose to be the one going there instead? 

Surely, Athalia, the goddess who he was following would have forgiven him for failing his mission if he did something like that, but he just couldn&#39;t find the courage to do so, with the feeling of sadness of loosing a new friend, who might have been pretty young still, but seemed to he so brave only made him feel even worse, so he decided to let Rose take care of her for now, as she seemed to take a better care of her for now anyway

He looked around the walls for a few seconds, as the ship was getting crushed by the beast outside of if before he would follow the other three, probably being in the back with a heavy feeling of guilt tainting his usually cheeful mind for now, feeling a little surprised by how cruel this world was to certain people in it... </div>

While waiting for Garg to speak to the sirens and relay further details, Rose pushed open the door to the lowest room in the ship. </div>

He kneeled down, allowing her to view him sight to sight.  There were the sound of musical notes and the girl seemed to look upon him, tears streaming down her face.  &quot;Are you going to eat me?&quot;

More music, but the figure shoke his head.  

&quot;Are you going to let my mommy and daddy go?&quot;

The others could now here the hisses of dismay, screams from below in anger and resentment.  The elemental nodded.   Then the people around them, thirty in all suddenly turned towards the group and began to slowly walk towards them, still milky white eyes, still tranced, but they slowly walked up the stairs.

Somewhere in the crowd, the elemental and the girl disappeared... not a trace of them in the water.

It was only when the crew reached the top deck did they start to hold their head and start asking questions. </div>

<em>With the crowd of people starting to walk towards them, eyes still cloudy, he became a little worried that they were going to be attacked, as the group looked like they were under some sort of a spell, but thankfully they walked past the three of them. The white haired boy was staying behind, feeling a burning sensation on his legs, as they were standing in ice cold water still, which, at this point was enough to feel as if his skin was burning, but he was waiting. He was waiting for the rest of the people to disappear, trying to peek around some of their shoulders, hoping that by some miracle, Amelia was still there, though deep down in his heart, he knew that she was probably gone at this point, only willing to head back up with the rest of the crew, and the two adventurers after he would make sure</em> </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Rose’s heart felt heavy. It saddened her watching this brave little girl leave to face and unknown future. There was a semblance of solace being certain she’d be treated well at the very least. Yes. Amelia Day would become known throughout the lands. She would make sure of it. And she’d commemorate this sacrifice the moment she was able. 

“Well, that’s done,” Rose said softly, not caring if anyone felt the sorrow she was in that moment. She clutched Amelia’s egg tightly. “Now to find the egg’s mother.” The eladrin sighed, looking down at her bare feet immersed in the water. Fortunately, the blanket remained dry. So she wasn’t daring as poorly as she had earlier. Not wanting to test things, she moved towards the stairs, following the crowd. The people would need an explanation anyway... especially Amelia’s parents. 

Once up above, Rose watched the people start to come out of the spell those sirens had cast. Pursing her lips, body still shivering, she waited for those questions to come. “I know you have questions. So, please, one at a time.” She sucked in a sharp breath, exhaling slowly. “Though first, who are the parents of a child named, Amelia?” </div>

Though she’d dried off and was much warmer, she wasn’t out of the woods. The eladrin felt her own tears falling, as she was shaken. Screamed at. The girl suddenly couldn’t hold it back. “She was brave. She saved us all. I promised her.... Amelia’s Day.” She was sniffling, pale eyes watery. “Light lanterns on the water, give a meaningful gift to someone not expecting it. Commemorate her... please...” She was begging, but she hardly cared. That child did what most could not. It would be something that would stick with her. Forever.

Once the woman—clearly Amelia’s mother—seemed to settle down, Rose noticed a shadow looming overhead. The eladrin looked up, white hair whipping about, while she pulled the blanket tight. An airship?
