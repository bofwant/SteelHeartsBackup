Even the wind seems to be mindful of this beautiful altar, holding back it&#39;s strength to provide a soft breeze that carried soft smelling flower petals around, giving it a more magical feel to the place where the main ceremony is going to take place.

Soft and wonderful music provided with the perfect atmosphere for the wedding, even if it hasn&#39;t really started yet.

Some crew staff were putting the final touches while everyone else arrived to this big event sponsored by the guild master. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="01-Jul-20 01:16 PM">(edited)</span></div>

Bofwant, the resident doctor of the med bay arrived at the center of the top deck where the actual ceremony was going to take place. &quot;Very beautiful...&quot; He said to himself as he looked at the amazing work that the ship staff had done to celebrate the union of two fellow members who also has a child on the way.

He took a deep breath, enjoying the calm atmosphere before starting to walk towards the altar to prepare. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Having been invited, Uthal took some time to clean himself. As much as he could anyway; Goliaths always held a kind of musty air about them, very mute if they bothered to clean themselves properly. Byproduct of having such a strong connection to the towering mountains which gave them life, the eruptions of force from the world itself. 

He had nothing fancy to wear, as he knew was expected...But if there was to be battle as he had heard, then such things would be pointless. Besides, he knew not to go naked. As such, he did cover himself in the upper chest with a simple tunic, and made his way to where the ceremony would be held. And when he reached there, he was greeted with quite the elaborate set-up. Well now, they truly went all out; a tinge of pride he felt for Mors. Not only helping to bring new life to the world, but showing that even in the finer things he would push for only the best. 

His massive stature was almost impossible to miss as he crossed across the main hall, looking for Irithriel and Mors to congratulate them one last time. However, his travels would lead him to the <span class="mention">#dining</span> area, seeing a few guild members already there. </div>

He heard the big steps before he raised his eyes and saw the Goliath pass towards the dining tent. *A friend of Mors perhaps?&quot; He wondered but did nothing to answer that question, just took a deep breath and enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere of the place and the pleasant music coming from the stage in the entertainment area. He noticed that the background music had stopped and someone had started to perform and it made him smile a little, knowing that people could still enjoy the beauty of life. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Sela had told Bofwant that she’d meet him later at the the event, knowing he needed to gather his notes for the wedding ceremony. He’d been toiling away on what to say in between shifts in the med bay. If she wanted to be honest about it, she would dare say he was stressed and understandably so. And to make matters worse, she’d dropped the news upon him that she’d made a contract with her herald, something she’d hoped would ease his mind and give him one less thing to worry about. “Bofwant...” she then called out, her now flawless face like fine porcelain, her pretty gown a warm shade of red, making her look like a welcoming sunset. 

On the other side of the area, Hal had made her way up to the top deck. The girl had to return the books to the library before meeting Garg, like she’d promised. And it wasn’t hard for her to find the boisterous shark. The moment her eyes found him, she couldn’t help but smile and quickly make her way over to him. “Sorry I’m a little late. But I returned my books, as I’d said, Captain.” Her expression turned slightly coy and she tilted her head, bruises and cuts very visible to anyone looking on. “Have you been waiting long?” she asked, hands moving to smooth out the pretty blue silk that she donned. The ship had provided her an exquisite dress the shade of her eyes for the occasion, and she was quite happy to show her appreciation and wear it. Looking back up, the girl glanced about the area, her eyes noting a familiar face... the abomination! How did a Rookwood find their way on board? She’d thought the twins were dead! <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="01-Jul-20 09:44 PM">(edited)</span></div>

                    <div class="markdown">Bofwant kept an eye on the strange shark like man. He had heard stories about them but actually never seen a sharkin since most of his career was on dry land. It was just too painful to get assignments at the navy because it made him think of his little brother too much. His special senses and experience made him aware of the dark nature of the pirate?&#39;s magic. He had seen his fair share of magic armor but never something like the shark was wearing.

His thoughts were interrupted when he heard his name being called. &quot;Sela...&quot; He called back before standing up from his spot and walking towards her. &quot;You look beautiful.&quot; He told her softly. &quot;I believe this is the first time I have seen you in a dress.&quot; A small smile formed on his face for her. He had decided that for today he would only focus on the good things, on the love their shared and not on his feelings about her becoming a warlock in the process of facing her fears.

After a minute Garg managed to open the barrel by taking off the whole lid, the strong smell of sharkin rum should have filled the area around him but it seems that that big ass tree and those pansy flowers in the wind were more magical than they looked. &quot;Fuck you....&quot; He growled a little at a flying petal that landed in his nose before he was interrupted by Hal&#39;s and another elf&#39;s arrival.

&quot;Looking fancy aren&#39;t ya shadow girl?&quot; He growled teasingly at her and just scoped some rum with his mug before gulping some. &quot;Fuck, this shit never gets old. Want some?&quot; He offered the mug to her. He noticed others around, like the elf and the soldier and the annoying voice of that wizard in the distance but he had decided to ignore them until she was drunk enough. </div>

I’m sure the couple you’re marrying will be completely taken with what you say.” She was so proud of him and wanted her beloved to know she’d be supporting him the whole time. 

Across the way, Hal just blinked at the sight of the Rookwood twin. A part of her felt relief to see one of them alive, though she wondered if the male was just as alive and well as his sister. Though, she supposed that would have to wait. For now... the girl watched Garg gulp down an almost full mug-ful of rum... she had other things occupying her attention. “Do you like it?” she asked the shark, turning a bit to show off those assets she knew he enjoyed looking at. With every turn, he would see how well the fine fabric clung to her body, the way his marks stood out on her fair features. A blaring sign that she was his and no other’s. “Hrmm...” she went on contemplating a drink. The girl had fairly low tolerance, so she knew pacing would mean everything. “Perhaps just a sip of yours. I don’t think my tolerance is as good as your own.” </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Bofwant&#39;s smile widened a little after hearing Sela&#39;s word of encouragement. &quot;This is not my first wedding... But it is the first one that has been properly planned. All the other ones I had done in the middle of a battlefield or the war camp. Just a quick words and a blessing to the couple.&quot; He sighed then, &quot;This couple is a very interesting one. An elf and a Goliath.&quot; He noticed more and more people arriving and just mingling together which made him feel a little more at ease. &quot;It is very nice that you are here with me today... After the ceremony would you gift me a dance? Heh, this time let&#39;s not drink until we are ready to retire for the night&quot; his voice was light and happy, remembering those funny moments when she experienced alcohol for the first time.

Meanwhile Garg just raised an eyebrow at Hal, &quot;Do you see any other mug? This is the only one and I&#39;m feeling generous today...&quot; He growled at her, an evil grin appearing in his face. &quot;This is sharkin rum, a special recipe from sharanthis. At least those assholes make good things.&quot; He just emptied the mug, drinking all it&#39;s contents before scooping some more of the precious liquid and shoving the mug towards Hal. &quot;Why do you keep looking at that elf? Looking for more potential members for the raid? Or is she your sister or something?&quot; He asked while gesturing to her and Sela&#39;s red hair. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Sela nodded, the smile never leaving her face, while she listened to Bofwant. She was glad he was getting to preside at this particular wedding and, most importantly, be a part of it with him. If even just by being there on the sidelines. “Oh, I’d love a dance!” she exclaimed happily, remembering when she’d danced for him for the very first time. She’d been tipsy, having had her first true taste of alcohol. It hadn’t taken much for it to affect her. So she definitely knew Bofwant’s suggestion at waiting to drink was sage advice to follow. “And I agree. My tolerance is quite low, as we both know,” she added with a giggle. Moving closer to her beloved, she noticed a red haired elf looking her way every so often, though she decided not to pay it any mind for the moment. 

“Oh no no,” Hal explained. “Not a sister. I only have a brother. But... I believe that’s my cousin,” she went on, knowing for certain it was the Rookwood girl her aunt had wanted eliminated. Their own flesh and blood! It sickened her that she’d once followed her aunt so blindly. “But that’s doesn’t matter...” Suddenly Hal was afraid, a sense of dread knotting up her insides. If Selaphiel Rookwood knew who she was... what had been desired by the matriarch... her cousin would hate her for forever! Not that she’d blame the poor girl. Blinking, she looked at the mug Garg had thrust into her hands and took a long draw of the liquid. The girl coughed then, the drink burning, as she swallowed it down. Handing the mug back to the sharkin, she noticed Warden enter the area. With a smile, she leaned against Garg and whispered, her voice slightly slurred, “The Warden is here... look.” </div>

But I&#39;d there any chance that you might know that other elf? The one drinking with the shark man?&quot; He asked her softly after breaking the kiss but keeping their faces close, lips still lightly touching the others and his voice almost a whisper so only she could hear him.

Meanwhile Garg just laughed a little at Hal, &quot;Feeling it already shadow girl? It packs a punch. The best booze on the fucking world.&quot; He growled natbhwr after noticing her words slurring na little already and took the mug from her hands before emptying in a single gulp. &quot;If she&#39;s your cousin then we could use her too for the raid!&quot; He growled merrily and passed his free arm around Hal&#39;s shoulders before waving with the one holding the now empty mug. &quot;Hey you! The red girl! Come here, shadow girl here says you&#39;re her fucking cousin!&quot; Yep, it seemed that the alcohol was affecting him too already...

                    <div class="markdown">Sela sighed softly, while looking up at Bofwant. Never had she felt such love before. Sure, the girl knew her brother loved her and he’d always sacrificed himself to uphold her safety... even if it had meant both would suffer in the end. The point was that Barachiel had always tried. But again, it had been different. As she looked up into her love’s eyes, her expression dreamy, she didn’t notice Jarreth’s seething state, the herald mumbling in infernal from a dark corner where neither she nor Bofwant could see him. Just as he wanted it. The love those two shared made him ill. He’d have to do something about that when the opportunity presented itself. “Hrmm?” she mused, turning in the direction Bofwant had indicated. Sure enough, there was an elf who certainly looked like she could be a sister. 

Meanwhile, across the large space, Hal looked up at Garg, her pale face flushed pink due to the rum she’d just tried. “Y-yes...” she slurred. “No more for me... I... I want to enjoy and remember the... the party.” The girl still had her wits about her, but one more sip and she’d need to be carried off to bed. Hal turned her focus inward, trying to still the effects of the alcohol on her tiny elven body. Just then, she heard Garg call after the Rookwood girl. “Uhh... no... Captain... I...” But it was too late. Selaphiel Rookwood was looking her way and no doubt confused. She knew the girl had no idea of her lineage or what she truly was. She’d probably have her evening destroyed if she knew the truth. Though perhaps Selaphiel might prove understanding. It was anyone’s guess. One thing was certain though. She was glad to see she was somehow alive. Now if she could only be sure about the girl’s twin. Needing to ease her own mind, Hal just grinned sheepishly and gave a quick wave to Selaphiel. 

Across the way, Sela just tilted her head, eyebrows furrowed. “No, I don’t think so. Resemblance is uncanny, but I’ve no one except Barachiel. Though why did she wave at me?” </div>

It seemed that a wedding was always an event where other couples formed. He too noticed Jericho approaching with his guards, the smile slowly dissapearing from his face with a groan. He really didn&#39;t want to deal with him right now so he decided that it was best to figure out things about that other elf waving at then. &quot;The bride and groom must be getting ready so we have some time to sparw. Should we go and see if this lady knows you or about your parents my love?&quot; He asked Sela while offering her his arm like a gentleman before moving to meet Garg and Hal.

Meanwhile the sharkin just laughed at warden and reached with his mug to scoop more rum. &quot;Aye. Me and shadow girl here are planing a raid to get her brother!&quot; Of course, he left unsaid the part about stealing the elves treasure. Money was always a given. &quot;We need long range weapons and yours is fucking perfect for the job. Are you interested?&quot; He poked Warden on the chest with the mug before taking a drink from it. Then he turned his head after noticing nthat Hal was waving at the other elf. &quot;No what shadow girl?&quot; He asked Hal, not really getting why she was stuttering. </div>

The herald knew the paladin could sense him, but he held no power here. Not in such a public venue. He could do as he pleased... to anyone! “I can already tell it’ll be a lovely ceremony. Everything looks so wonderful.” Jarreth just rolled his eyes. He despised this bond his darling girl held with the soldier. “But yes, might as well go see. No harm in that.”

“Hello, Warden,” Hal said with a bright smile. Her neck and collar bone appeared to be somewhat shredded, relatively fresh wounds just starting to truly heal. “Always nice to see you.” The goliath was her first real friend on board the ship and she’d always welcome a kind face. “And yes, we hope to rescue my brother. You remember me telling you about Keth?” She hoped the man did, the two had exchanged a fair bit not so long ago. The girl then turned back to Garg, leaning close and whispering, “No, I just am not ready to face my cousin. She... she doesn’t know. I don’t wish to ruin her time at such a festive time.” But it was already too late, Hal could see the Rookwood girl already approaching them. “Oh and hello, Mr Day,” she added, noticing the peculiar cat who’d said elves of his world had tails. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="03-Jul-20 07:04 AM">(edited)</span></div>

I don&#39;t believe that I have seen any of you around the med bay yet... That&#39;s good.&quot; He greeted the gathered group formed by Garg, Hal, Warden and Tomara. It was obvious that he was not good at this small talk thing. He was the kind of only speak when needed but he was making an effort to not be the boring silent soldier today, mostly for Sela.

Garg meanwhile just kept drinking more rum, not as fast as he started because he was feeling it already and wanted to make it last the whole event. &quot;Ha! Of course not. Do you think that only three fuckers can raid a castle in another fucking plane?!&quot; He started to answer Warden while shaking his head, his free arm still around Hal&#39;s shoulders. &quot;No my man. We are putting together a fucking crew!&quot; He cheered, making some of the alcohol spill from his mug. &quot;And weapons!&quot; The shark was interrupted by the arrival of Tomara, &quot;Ah! The not rat alright! Listen shadow girl, this is about lesson, you always need to know who has potential and who doesn&#39;t. I&#39;ll let you decide this time if this one is good for the job...&quot; He growled in her ear but still being loud enough that everyone could heard him because oviously he doesn&#39;t give a fuck. Then he raised his eyes to look at the new couple that has arrived. &quot;Captain Garg DreadStorm, the Boogeyman of the fucking Sea!&quot; He cheered towards Bofwant and Sela, making his classic introduction. &quot;And of course not! No idiot can easily take me down, not anymore!!&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Sela has linked her arm with Bofwant’s, just wanting to stay close to him for as long as possible. She looked at the other red head, her golden eyes just staring, taking things in. 

Hal just stared back, a nervousness rising from within. There was no avoiding things and she’d eventually have to tell Selaphiel just who she was. It would come out eventually, and better from her than someone else. She just hoped she’d be forgiven, especially since she’d never agreed with the manhunt to begin with, having devised an escape plan that never needed to happen. “Hello, I’m Halanaestra Ellorenthi,” she said, voice slightly slurred thanks to the rum.

Sela just looked at Hal quizzically. Was she supposed to know the girl? She seemed to know her. “H-hello.”

“If I’m not mistaken and, I apologize for being so bold,” Hal went on, trying her best to use courtly manner while talking to Selaphiel. “You must be Selaphiel Rookwood.”

Sela’s eyes widened. This girl knew her? How? She’d been sequestered away almost her whole life and now a girl who looks like a sister suddenly knows who she is? “B-b-but... I... I... I...” she stammered. 

Hal blanched, her face suddenly showing worry. “Oh, I’m sorry!” she exclaimed. “I didn’t mean to upset... oh, I’m doing this wrong!”

Sela could see that Hal hadn’t meant any harm, so she just shook her head and reached out a hand. “No, it’s all right. I was just startled anyone knew me,” she explained. 

Hal just nodded. “Well, if you are indeed Selaphiel then...” She paused, not sure how exactly to proceed. “Then you’re my cousin. Through your mother and my father...”

Immediately, Sela’s jaw dropped. Had she heard things correctly? Was this girl indeed family? She certainly looked it, only their eyes gave things away. Deciding not to think on it, Sela just moved to hug Hal, tears suddenly rolling down her cheeks. 

“I...” Hal had been taken off guard, not expecting her cousin to be happy about the news. But it gave her that hope she sorely needed. </div>

Despite being... <em>Tipsy</em>... His sharkin senses were sharp like always. As soon as he felt that other elf moving to hug Hal, Garg removed his arm from Hal&#39;s shoulders and took a step away with a growl. &quot;Whatch it shadow girl number 2!&quot; Then he just shook his head and turned towards warden, letting Hal have her family reunion. &quot;So you think you can recruit fuckers huh? Alright, I&#39;m in need of more officials, let&#39;s see what you can do.&quot; He growled at the Goliath and gestured towards Tomara. </div>

The girl’s head flooded with questions. Looking into Hal’s bright blue eyes, she just smiled and gasped, wiping at the tears staining her pretty face. “I’m sorry, I just didn’t know... how do you even know who I am when I barely know? Why were we not allowed to know others in our family? J-just... why...?”

Hal bit down on her lower lip and nodded. She wasn’t surprised by the questions. If it had been her who’d been hidden away, she’d have her share of questions too. “Not every Ellorenthi knew, Selaphiel,” she went on. 

“Sela. Please, call me Sela.”

“Sela,” Hal then said with a smile. “And you can call me Hal.” Hal’s comment made Sela smile. Hal then tilted her head. “Well there’s much to tell, though perhaps not here. I’d rather we talk more after the ceremony.”

“Oh, of course,” Sela interjected, reaching out to touch Hal’s arm in understanding. “I’d like that very much.”

Hal nodded, happy to have avoided a potentially emotional scene. The girl still worried that the Rookwood girl would forever hate her when she learned the true desires of their aunt. The fact that their aunt had had her duped for so very long. Their family was a complicated one, and though on the throne within the house of the shadow marked, she knew in her heart it belonged to the Phiarlan family. “Yes. Though we are cousins, a-a part of me has always wanted a sister.” Hal’s face reddened. “Though my brother...”

“A brother? Another cousin?” Sela squeaked, looking up at Bofwant with a smile. 

Hal nodded. “Yes. Keth. But... he is in danger and I need to rescue him.”

“Oh!” Sela exclaimed, her expression showing worry. “If you need aid, just say the word. You are my blood, so you have my love.” It was a bold statement, but Sela was starved for a family that could love her and her cursed twin. </div>

That&#39;s new!&quot; After managing to calm down he heard warden talking to him now and frowned a little. &quot;This is nothing! A true pirate can fight even when truly poisoned!... Fuck! Ha! Look at that not rat go!&quot; Then, He also noticed Margot coming closer and just growled, perfect more fuckers... He shook his head and put the lid on the barrel of rum before easily hauling it over his shoulder. It was obvious that he was used to do such a thing thanks for his years of experience at sea. &quot;Come on then... This will be fun to see and I&#39;ll run the bets!&quot; He growled at Warden before starting to walk towards the arena. As he walked away following Tomara towards the <span class="mention">#arena</span>, his shark tail bumped against Hal&#39;s legs like it had gotten used to do lately, but it was like he didn&#39;t even noticed anymore. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Hal was touched that her cousin was gracious enough to extend such heartfelt words her way. She figured Sela would probably change her mind if she knew the whole truth of it. But that was for a later time. Right then, she wanted them both to enjoy themselves. And, truth be told, she wanted to hold onto this warm feeling of having family once more, since her own had been so heartlessly torn away from her. “Why thank you,” she said softly, giving her cousin a smile. 

Sela looked up at Bofwant, beaming happily at what she’d just learned. Though her own heart twisted a little that he’d yet to find his own lost brother. Perhaps she could strike up another bargain with Jarreth... no doubt it would please the soldier greatly to have aid and finally be reunited. It was something to consider at the very least. Meanwhile, Jarreth could only grin at how his Sela’s thoughts were spinning. Soon, chaos would ensue, and the already broken girl would fracture all the more, her magic seeping through those fissures for him to devour and savor. 

While Hal and Sela got acquainted, neither noticed the hustle and bustle about them. It was to be expected given the state of things. Though Hal felt the obvious pet of Garg’s tail against her legs, making her shiver. Hal glanced over her shoulder then, watching the shark head over to the large arena that had been set up. “Perhaps we should follow,” she then suggested to Sela, watching her Captain take his leave, while encouraging something about... a fight, or duel? Hal bit down on her lip and then heard Warden urging them on. 

Sela glanced between Hal, Bofwant, and the myriad of people about them all. She turned towards Bofwant, looking up at him. “Will you come with me?” she asked him, wanting to remain close, and still wanting to soak in the newness of having more family. Oh, she’d have to break this news to Barachiel later! </div>

Magic is not my specialty, I am a doctor and occasionally preside over ceremonies such as the one that is going to take place today... Perhaps you could find what you need in <span class="mention">#rikkas-rationing</span> or <span class="mention">#alchemy-lab</span> ? Even <span class="mention">#hopes-requisition-services</span> could have what you need.&quot; He politely answered her.

Then he turned towards Sela, &quot;Of course my love. I am sure what Mr. Clay will let us all know when it&#39;s time for the ceremony.&quot; He took a step closer before giving Hal a small nod. &quot;I am Bofwant, the resident doctor in the <span class="mention">#med-bay</span>&quot; He made his small introduction to Hal cousin before offering his arm to Sela. &quot;Shall we?&quot; It was obvious that he was making an effort to use all those proper manners he had been taught when he started climbing ranks within the watchers. </div>

The arena had been too loud and rowdy for her tastes, so something quiet had certainly been in order. The girl glanced around at the decorations, pretty hydrangea and tulips strewn everywhere. They brightened the entire top deck, their fragrance wafting through the fresh air and instantly bringing about calm.

“Everything looks so lovely,” Sela commented, just taking a moment to soak it all in. “You ready?” she then asked, turning towards Bofwant and knowing it wouldn’t be long before he read the ceremony he’d put together for the couple being wed that day. “It’s going to be beautiful.” </div>

“Oh, my love,” Sela immediately started. “If this is about your own brother, please know I will help there however able. I know what it’s like to be separated from your sibling. It... it’s awful.” The girl moved in to hug the man again, hardly caring about how cold and hard the armor he donned might be. 

Indeed, Sela remembered all too well how gut wrenching and heartbreaking it had been to be separated from her Barachiel. He was her twin. Her best friend. The one who’d been there always, during those darkest of times. Even now they were still connected, her having dreams of demons past, him of demons future. Different, yet the same. A perfect balance. 

“We will find him, my love,” Sela tried to reassure. She then looked up into Bofwant’s eyes. “Any ideas on where to start?” </div>

So far, no other clue about him has appeared to me but no matter where he is, I am sure that he is happy and making new friends, he never let anything upset him even if he could be very weird about payback.&quot;

Bofwant kissed Sela again and then pulled back a little. &quot;No. We don&#39;t have any memory of our parents or family, since the beginning it was just the two of us in that house at the edge of the village so I am very hay that you found a new member of your family.&quot; </div>

Slow big steps heralded the arrival of the groom. The ones that already knew him probably would be surprised at the sight of the giant overlord in such a colorful attire. Instead of his normal dark armor, he was clad in a golden one. Somehow the shiny golden plate didn&#39;t take his scary prescence away. Big warhammer, also new a shiny, resting over his big right shoulder plate. Giant shield somehow hanging into his back over the golden cape. The sight of Mors was... Fancy, yet scary. Thanks to his new powers, the shadows casted by his big shape seemed to be alive with power and moving in unnatural ways. 

Slowly the overlord made his way towards the altar, following the guild master. He had been taken away from his pregnant mate early just after the sunrise. He had left his minions with Irithriel and the female Clay&#39;s while he followed the skeleton man and iron tower towards the forge. Apparently this ceremony required a special clothes. Somehow they knew he wouldn&#39;t accept anything less so they had given him this armor that fit as perfectly as his own misterious one. He didn&#39;t remember how he had gotten his dark armor but somehow the Guild Master has made this one from the same material that enhanced his dark powers even if this one looked like gold instead of coal.

As he looked at the altar he smiled under his helmet. &quot;She will like this...&quot; He grumbled to himself and kept walking, practically ignoring everyone else that was in the area. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Sela nodded at Bofwant, giving the man a nuzzle. Once things were sorted with Jarreth, she knew they needed to start taking steps to find his brother. No doubt it ached terribly not knowing where he was. She’d been distraught without Barachiel, deciding her love must be feeling the same way. “I’m glad you found me, my love. But I long for you to reunite with your own brother much like I have mine. Perhaps we can ask the guild master. I’m sure he has connections.”

Sela was about to say more, but was cut short when the music softly began to play. Looking towards the back of the area, she then saw one of the largest men she’d ever laid her eyes upon. In that moment, she felt her heart speed up, her breaths coming hard and fast. The girl hadn’t expected a giant—well, half... or, part—she remembered that oni. It had been so large compared to her. Giving her that scar... her hand moved to the scar that Jarreth had taken away. It was unnatural. Wrong. Oh! Just what had she done! 

For a moment, Sela closed her eyes and steadied her breathing. Her own troubles now had to wait. For now, her love was needed. He needed to preside over the ceremony. “I’ll find a seat,” she mumbled, giving Bofwant a sweet yet soft kiss. “You’ll be wonderful, my love.” At that, she moved to find the first seat she could. </div>

Even if they were not as big as giants physically, and Parker would see that he was possibly as big as Mors, perhaps even larger in terms of size. But Uthal put his eyes on Mors, seeing the giant in his fancy armor; it was a time to celebrate indeed, and it seemed Uthal had been beaten in the arena of high fashion.

&quot;Hm, if Mors came dressed like this, I only wonder what his bride will be dressed like.&quot; Uthal muttered; indeed, of most of the people here, they would see he was rather drabbily garbed, but among the Katho-Olavi this was &#39;fancy dress&#39;. Clothing not torn or worn from hard labor or battle, and no blood to mar the simplistic fabric; it was the garments they wore to any high function. Even if it made them still look like the lowest of peasants in terms of attire. </div>

Her delicate hands smoothed out the shimmery sheer wisps of fabric that was her wedding dress, the material clinging to her curves and accentuating her belly, which was swollen with hers and Mors’ son. In the girl’s mind, their little Aeran was just as present at the event, as everyone else who was a part of the Steel Hearts guild. 

With a smile lighting up her pretty face, Iri peered out at the gathered crowd. Her cool, grays noted her goliath friends and the guild master, himself. But it was hard not to notice her mate. Waiting there. Just for her. In that moment, she blushed and felt a tiny hand reach up for her own. The little blue minion gave her a winning smile, and she could tell the other was fluffing her veil. The little green stood before her and beckoned her forward, the sweet darling tossing flower petals from a basket it carried. 

“Ready then,” Iri whispered happily, letting one blue lead her down the aisle towards Mors, while the other tended her veil and train. It wasn’t hard following the flower trail left by the green, the fragrant aroma of flowers filling the air. Her free hand caressed her belly, as if holding Aeran close. As she approached Mors, she felt her face grow hotter, her smile become bigger. He was the most wonderful being in the room, the sight of him enough to make her heart flutter and know she’d truly found her other half. </div>

Their child and Irithriel herself, he felt no pity for any who might dare make a move against either of them.

It also made him think of <em>his</em> future; strange how this reflected in this moment of serenity. He&#39;d fought and fought and fought; and while he was still young, he knew he could be stolen away at any moment. But...Would he even make a good parent? Goliaths rarely lived to old age, unless they were exceptionally powerful. And while he was mighty, there were plenty of others who were stronger still. 

And if there was one thing the Katho-Olavi prided themselves on, it was raising the next generation to be stronger than the last.

Still, his focus was on the glorious elf walking towards the altar, towards him. He felt an unexplainable feeling because it was also very clear to all those gathered around that not only they belonged to eachother but that their mighty family was growing too. Just the glorious sight in front of him made this whole thing worthy to the goliath.

It had been her intent to wait for her one though, the girl truly knowing the shark beside her was. She wondered if the bride had done the same. Her blue gaze moved to the bride and the moment they fixed upon her, they widened and she gasped. How was this possible? She rubbed at her eyes and looked again, confirming her eyes were not playing any sort of trick. Right there before her, she saw the Phiarlan Princess. “By the gods...” she whispered. Everyone back in the Feywild had thought the princess to be dead, though it was her family, the last link to the Phiarlan bloodline that many secretly wanted on the throne. Keth had been a supporter of Vaegon Ravenwood, so had their parents... their parents! They’d died trying to right the usurpation of the founding family! Hal still remembered the letter her brother had shown her, the one before the Baron took him away. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">After the couple was ready for things to proceed, the healer took a deep breath and steeled his expression. It was time to start the actual ceremony. As if on cue, the music stopped, leaving the whole area in silence. Not even the strong wind of the sky could be heard, probably thanks to the magic surroundings the altar.

&quot;Today.&quot; He started, his voice strong and clear so everyone could easily understand him. &quot;The whole Steel Hearts guild is gathered in this special place, to witness the joining of these two members in the eyes of the gods and people.&quot;

He took another breath before starting again. &quot;We are gathered here, to celebrate one of the best expressions of love... But what is love?&quot; He let the question ring around the area for a moment.

&quot;Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails. But whether there  are prophecies, they will fail; whether there  are tongues, they will cease; whether there  is knowledge, it will vanish away.But love, true love shall always remain.&quot; The words he said we&#39;re charged with holy power that could be felt by everyone gathered there.

He smiled then, looking at the couple in front of him. &quot;Now it&#39;s time for Irithriel Ravenwood and Mors to declare their love in front of us all.&quot; And with that he cued the couple so they will say what they wanted before the officially declared them married. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">The overlord listened to he Healer&#39;s words but his glowing eyes never left the glorious sight of his mate.

As Bofwant did his speech, Mors started to ponder on those words. Love... He still couldn&#39;t remember what exactly that was. Every child had a concept of love from their childhood but he guessed that it was something he had lost when he first died in the sea. Whatever it has been, he was completely sure that it didn&#39;t compare to what he felt for his mate.

Even if those words coming from the paladin were close to what he felt, it still was no enough to describe what he felt... &quot;My little moon...&quot; He started but then paused himself. It was no secret that the language of giants was not made for fancy words and their pronunciation... And even if he could speak common, it was hard for him to say some words and that was one of the reasons he had never pronounced his mate&#39;s true name in front of her, not wanting to butcher something so precious. But for this, he had practiced in secret so at least once he would be able to say it properly.

&quot;Irithriel...&quot; He said slowly, barely managing to pronounce it right. &quot;Since the moment we met on this same place, I knew you were something glorious... But it was not until you showed me how much of a fool I was being that I knew that you were the one for me... Made for me... My mate.&quot;

He paused for a moment, only the evil echoes of his words could be heard before he started speaking again. &quot;I told you that we shall live in our own way. Not following the rules of the fools. But even then, here we are. Showing everything in existence that we are one and the same and there is nothing that shall keep us apart.&quot; </div>

She is the rightful heir to the shadow marked throne after her older brother Vaegon.” The red head leaned closer still. “My aunt stole the throne from my mother’s kin. My mother was Phiarlan, but not a direct descendant of the royal family. My father was Ellorenthi and his sister—my aunt—now sits on a throne that isn’t hers.” She left it at that.

she started. “From the moment we met, I knew I wanted to see you smile. And it wasn’t long before I hoped to be one thing that could bring about that smile.” The girl stepped closer, her free hand reaching for his. “You’ve shown me what it is to face your desires. To conquer whatever it is that you need. You are my other half, my mate, my beast who makes me whole. I am beyond words right now, but I am ready to start my life as your wife and mother to our children. Oh what a glorious life it will be.” The pretty elf could feel her eyes growing damp, tears of happiness welling in those silvery gray pools, the moment so real, it was hard to contain all the emotions she felt right then and there. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Bofwant smiled, a full one, after hearing the couple say those words to eachother. One day, when he found his brother and helped Sela cure hers, he was sure that they will be the ones expressing their love in front of the world like that.

After a few moments of silence the healer took a deep breath and started to speak again. &quot;There is no such a thing that can stand against love. And today, in front of all of you and the gods. It is my pleasure to declare these two lovers as one being, one soul, one love.&quot;

Bofwant reached forward and grabbed both Irithriel&#39;s extended hand and Mors free one, joining them both and holding them between his own armored ones. &quot;Mors, here is your wife. Irithriel, here is your husband. By the power granted to me by the heavens, the law and you both, I declare you Husband and wife.&quot; In that moment, the couple could feel a wave of supernatural power wash over both of them, the ceremony was now complete and they were joined by it.

Bofwant released their joined hands and stepped back, to give them a moment. Unlike most priests he wouldn&#39;t tell them to kiss, it was up to each couple how much they wanted to show their live in public. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Mors looked into his mate&#39;s eyes as she spoke, feeling pride at her words. Even if he had been a fool at the beginning he had managed to make things right. And even after becoming lost and forgetting, his mate had found him and made him remember again. He had no doubt that is as the healer said. Nothing could keep them apart.

He didn&#39;t mind when the healer grabbed their hands without asking, for once his whole focus was on his mate and only her. Then he felt that weird energy wash over him, despite being completely different in nature as his dark one, he didn&#39;t fight it and let it do it&#39;s job somehow feeling more tied to his mate now.

Then it was over when the healer declared them married. The overlord lowered his warhammer to the floor, freeing his other hand so he could reach for his mouthpiece, easily taking it off without  needing to let go of Irithriel&#39;s hand. The unnatural darkness of his helmet still blocked the view of his face, only allowing the evil green of his glowing eyes to pierce through it... well, it was blocked for everyone but for the elf in front of him and his minions... maybe.

No words were needed. Even if he didn&#39;t care of what other fools thought, he would not leave any doubts that they belonged to eachother, so he easily reached for the pregnant elf, taking her in his arms and off the floor, mindful of her round belly, to close the gap between them and he could kiss her properly. </div>

When she heard those final words, the girl felt a rush of adrenaline, a peculiar warmth enveloping her and allowing her to feel the strength of the bond the two of them had just declared. Smiling up at him, she felt her tummy flutter, little Aeran doing somersaults in her belly, and waited for that long anticipated kiss. 

As Mors neared, Iri closed her eyes, her arms reaching for her mate, her one. Holding on, the girl went onto tiptoe, doing her best to deepen the kiss. Of course, nothing was ever enough when it came to expressing her love and her feelings. But it didn’t matter. The goliath knew. Her beast knew. “Mmm... I love you,” she then whispered, lips still moving against his right there in front of the altar. She felt a flower land on her head and, rather than break their first kiss as husband and wife, she just gently plucked it from her head and held it in her hand. </div>

After a minute he finally broke the kiss, a smile that only she could see was on his lips, reaching his evil glowing eyes. &quot;There is no words to describe what I feel, little moon... But love shall suffice for now. I love you too my wife.&quot; He whispered to her before he gave her a second shorter kiss and carefully lowered her down to the floor again, mindful of their growing child inside her.

Mors noticed the cries coming from above them but even if he was a little curious his eyes never stopped looking at his glorious wife. Completely unaware of the petals that were pierced by his helmet&#39;s spikes. </div>

&quot;Congratulations on the beginning of the res of your lives.&quot; He greeted the couple. His voice gentle but carrying the happiness he felt for what he considered his grandchildren. 

Then the old robot turned around so both the couple and the rest of the guild could properly hear him.

&quot;Steel Hearts. My family. Today we have witnessed a splendid show of love between our fellow guild members and to celebrate this old and proud robot had taken the liberty to prepare a series of special events.&quot;

He took a moment so everyone could settle down a little and hear his next words. &quot;Friendly competitions if you will. First, we will have a talents show in the <span class="mention">#entertainment</span> area for the bride! Then a small tournament in the <span class="mention">#arena</span>  for the groom! And we will finish this amazing evening with a family meal. An eating contest where not only the most ravenous can test their mettle but our best chefs can show their skills!&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s celebrate with Mr. Mors and Mrs. Irithriel and have a great party!&quot; And with that the music started once again as if by magic, this time a nice time, beckoning everyone towards the first official compensation of the evening. </div>
