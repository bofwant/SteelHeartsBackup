He followed her inside, &quot;I have spent so little time here since I arrived at the ship...&quot; He confessed, the room looked new, like it was recently remodeled and it was never lived in.

He put his things in the closet and took out a small pack of medicals supplies, then he sat on the edge of the bed and offered the pack to her, &quot;There&#39;s an ointment and bandages, will you help me?&quot; He asked her because he knew that not everyone was comfortable with being a healer, everyone could fight and draw blood because it was easy, but most faltered when they had the responsibility of someone else well-being in their hands. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Sela stepped inside Bofwant’s room, taking her time so she could get a longer glimpse at everything surrounding her. It was a simple room. Plain. And as he explained he didn’t spend much time there, it all seemed to make sense. She turned to look up at him and smiled reassuringly. “It’s lovely,”’she praised. “My own room isn’t very decorative, but it’s cozy.” Her cheeks went pink and she giggled. “I like that feeling of warmth,” she admitted. “The shadows have always provided. They were my way of finding peace... until now.” She gently touched his arm and gave it an affectionate squeeze. 

Walking in further, Sela walked towards the bed. It was made perfectly, the sheets taut and straight. A soldier’s bed. Though she wondered when he slept in it last. Bofwant had mentioned spending most of his time in the Med Bay. “Of course, I’ll help you,” she said, reaching for the med pack in his hand. The girl carefully opened it and inspected the items inside. “How’s the best way?” she asked. “Probably should remove your armor and shirt first.” She readied everything, while waiting for him to remove things. If he needed help, she would give him the aid. </div>

She helped him to get his chest bared again and he had to admit that he liked the way her hands felt on his bared skin. There was some bruising around his ribs and left shoulder, it was nothing serious, just a little painful, &quot;It&#39;s not hard Sela, just rub the ointment on the bruises and wrap the bandages around my chest and shoulder...&quot; He also had to admit that he liked this, teaching her the way to use her hands to help others, not just harm but heal, &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid to use force... the tighter, the better...&quot; He finished explaining and gave her another smile. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">With a nod and a smile, Sela tried to copy what Bofwant had explained. She first inspected his injuries, slim fingers dancing over his bruises. She frowned a bit, wishing her love wasn’t hurting. But she hoped that she could help ease the pain a little, learn something too. It felt good knowing she might be able to make him feel better. 

Sela took the vial of ointment then and placed some into the palm of her hand. Gently, she massaged it into the places Bofwant had indicated were bothering him most. Her hands worked the muscles, but her touch was tender and careful. When a layer of the healing salve was applied everywhere, she went for the bandages. She unraveled several strips and then did as he’d explained. 

“Is this right, Bofwant?” Sela asked, as she wrapped his chest. She tested the tightness with her fingers, making sure it would give him the support he needed without cutting off blood flow. Finally satisfied, she took a step back and then looked at him. “Hopefully, this helps,” she said shyly, moving back towards him so that she stood before him, while he sat on the edge of his bed. </div>

I was hoping you’d ask.” It was an admission, yes. But one she felt he needed to hear. 

Sela’s arms then wrapped about Bofwant’s neck. Each kiss sending her senses reeling. She could honestly stay in his arms all day long, just kissing and cuddling, hands exploring each other. It was those simple things that meant the most, things she’d hold onto while others took them for granted. “You’re my future now,” she then said. “So we have many memories to create together now. At least... I’d like to do that.” </div>

Together facing the world and all its challenges. There was something wonderful in knowing that. She planted soft kisses on his cheek, down along his jawline and then against his neck. Nuzzling him quietly, she then nodded. 

“Mm yes...” Sela answered, a smile playing on her lips. “After all that, some food would be lovely.” The girl sat up in Bofwant’s lap, her hands touching his his face, fingers twisting within his hair. “And I’d love to make dinner with you.” She squealed excitedly, the idea a fun and intimate one. She knew they now both had all the time they needed to try everything together, but she’d always be eager with him. 

Sela looked up at Bofwant adoringly, moving close to hug him. She was so glad she could be there for him. Someone who could be there always, to provide comfort and pleasure, a smile at the end of the day. She then slid off his lap and handed him his shirt. “This will be fun,” she added, a delighted thrill in her voice. Bofwant would be able to see her happiness... happiness that only he could provide. </div>

For a brief moment, she was reminded of her father and the first time she’d seen him drink down a glass. He hadn’t expected her to be lurking there and when he saw her... Luckily, her brother heard her cries. 

“I’ll do my best,” Sela said with a nod. She wasn’t sure what to expect and could feel a nervous flutter wash over her. Pushing out memories of the past, she dared to make memories for their future. Reaching for a glass, she brought it to her nose and inhaled deeply. It smelled sweet and fruity, a scent that made her feel warm inside. 

Licking her lips, Sela then brought the glass to her lips and let the red liquid fill her mouth. The taste wasn’t as sweet as she’d expected, but it was pleasing all the same. When she swallowed it down, a trail of heat seemed to follow. “Ohh...” she whispered, slightly astonished. She then took another sip, the heat spreading more, her skin feeling warm. “The taste is definitely good. I like it,” she then said with a smile. </div>

&quot;Come here...&quot; He said as he lowered their glasses in the table and pulled her for another kiss, it was a sudden impulse but he didn&#39;t resist it, she was just there, looking so sweet, so different from the haunted woman he had met in the top deck, so he just had to feel her in his arms again.

When he was done with her sweet mouth he pulled her with him towards the pantry, &quot;We will make a simple dish, we only need flour, salt, sugar, and cheese...&quot; He explained as he took the items and passed them to her so she could put them on the counter. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">The warmth of the wine was spreading throughout her body. It wasn’t an unpleasant sensation and probably why her father had always enjoyed it. Setting down her glass for a moment, Sela heard Bofwant’s request and immediately complied. He pulled her close, his lips so welcomed against her own. He was making her tummy flutter, her skin tingle heatedly, as the pleasant feelings began to grow. 

Sela whimpered softly when their lips parted, but her body remained close to Bofwant’s. Her hand found his, fingers entwining, as he pulled her towards the pantry in the kitchenette. She watched him take out a few simple things and she tilted her head curiously. 

“What are we making?” Sela then asked Bofwant, her red locks brushing against his arm, as she nuzzled him. She then tilted her head back to look up at the man and smiled, setting the items out one by one, as he handed them to her. “I’m rather excited to see how this turns out.” At that, she leaned against the counter, her head resting against her hands, with an innocent expression on her face, one full of eager wonder, as he prepared to show her something new. </div>

While she washed her hands he poured a lot of oil on the frying pan, &quot;We need the oil to be very hot before cooking this&quot;

After he had finished the preparations he put the bowl in front of her and grabbed the salt and flour, &quot;This is a special flour made of corn, it&#39;s fairly common from where I was born.

A time or two she glanced over her should to make sure she was doing things correctly. Bofwant moved to be behind her, his large arms encircling her body and pulling her close. She felt her back press against his chest, his hot breath brush her sensitive neck. The wine was already making her warm and heady, his closeness only making things... more. 

As Sela kneaded the dough and then added the sugar, she couldn’t help but sigh. Without realizing it, she tilted her head to the side, allowing Bofwant further access to her flesh, her tiny body shivering in his arms. “‘Mmm...” she groaned softly, her thoughts getting muddled due to the moment coupled with her first tastes of alcohol. “Feels nice...” </div>

After the dough was ready he released her and grabbed a chopping board and a thin leather cloth (DnD version of plastic cloth/bag). He put the leather over the board and then grabbed her hands, &quot;Now for this part we need to oil the leather, so the dough doesn&#39;t stick to it, and then grab a small ball of dough like this...&quot; He showed her how it was done and then out the bal on the oiled leather, &quot;... Now we stretch the dough until we form a disc, pour some cheese in the center and fold the disc in half using the leather, and using this&quot; He showed her a cup, &quot;we &#39;cut&#39; the excess of dough before removing the leather and here it is..&quot; when he peeled the leather back the dough was now a semicircle with cheese inside, then he wet his hands so the dough won&#39;t stick to them and very carefully of not breaking it he grabbed it and put it on the frying pan. &quot;Here we go, do you want to do the next one?&quot; He asked her with a smile. </div>

It was simple and sweet, one of appreciation and adoration. Drinking in the warmth of his closeness, she then continued to watch him show her the next steps for what they were making. Together. 

Sela made soft little noises and nodded, as she watched. And when it was her turn, she did her best to mimic what she’d been shown. “Is this right, Bofwant?” she asked. The girl likes when he taught her things, adding something new and exciting to her life. It had always been those little things, that attention to tiny details most overlooked, that struck her the hardest and in the best of ways. 

When Sela finished, her own not quite as perfect as the one Bofwant had made, she looked up at him with wide golden eyes. “Not as pretty as yours,” she admitted. “But hopefully as tasty.” Her cheeks already flushed from the alcohol had had turned a few shades darker. Biting down on her lip, she just hoped Bofwant approved of her attempt. The next one, she decided, would be better. </div>

&quot;Would you like to try the first one?&quot; He asked while refilling their glasses of wine, then he sat and gestured her to sit besides him. He had enjoyed teaching her his small recipe, these feelings blooming in his chest were very pleasant, specially when he saw her smile after accomplishing something. He wanted to do this again and again, to share with her everything he had learned during his life.

The things they had cooked had a very peculiar taste, the dough had hardened on the outside becoming crusty while still soft on the inside, like a very dense bread and the cheese had melted on the center so it all ended up in a strange but tasty combination. </div>

Any moment she had, she’d kiss him back, his lips, his neck. As he tasted one of the cheesey breads, she nuzzled at his neck, her breath hot against him. She liked how he smelled and felt. Just everything about him felt so very right. 

“Mm... yes, please,” Sela then answered and reached for own bit of bread to sample. It was a absolutely delicious and made her tummy rumble, as she swallowed it down. “This is quite good,” she then said, before giggling a bit. She’d seen that her wine glass was refilled, so she picked it up and took another long swallow. 

The heat worked its way down her middle, spreading all throughout her body. As Sela turned towards Bofwant, she felt her world start to spin just a bit. “Ohh...” she mumbled, not quite expecting it. She then smiled and giggled. “That was actually fun.” She looked up at the man, time suddenly slowing down, while the room swayed and danced. 

Danced... Just then, Sela popped another piece of cheesey bread into her mouth. She moaned in delight at its taste. Tugging on Bofwant’s arm, she gave him a small pout indicating she wanted him to follow. “Mm... the room is twirling...” she sighed. “So come dance with me, Bofwant... dance with me.” </div>

He still remembered when he and his brother had scrapped enough to buy a bottle of cheap rum and had gotten drunk out of their minds on their home, that was one of the reasons he had used alcohol as a way to block the memories of war when he arrived on the ship.

He pulled her into his arms so he was now sitting on his lap and have her a quick kiss, &quot;Why don&#39;t we rest tonight and tomorrow we will dance? I don&#39;t want to overdo my ribs today... Tomorrow I&#39;ll be rested, we can visit your brother and then go and dance, wouldn&#39;t you like that?&quot; He asked her after the kiss. </div>

Then there were his lips... so firm and sure. Oh she could kiss him all day. With a sigh, she then looked up at him, her lower lip jutting out in sweet little pout. “Ohh... I guess tomorrow will be all right,” she sighed. The girl scowled then, a playful curve tugging at her lips. Her golden eyes then shifted slightly, focusing on his shoulder, while her fingers reached to gently test it. “Still hurting?” she asked him, her touches light and careful despite the dizzy lightheaded sensation taking over her body. 

Sela sat there a moment on Bofwant’s lap, face flushed from the wine. Suddenly, her expression lit up and she gasped happily. “Oh! I know!” she suddenly exclaimed, giggling a bit. “You rest and I’ll dance!” At that, the elf stood up and spun around, twirling her lithe little body before him. When she stopped spinning, she bobbled a bit, which only made her giggle more. “See! It’s perfect!” The room was swaying, so the girl let her body just move despite the lack of music about them. Suddenly, as if on cue, the girl started to hum. It was an older tune, the elf unsure how she even knew it. Not that it mattered... she was dancing for her Bofwant! She moved her body before the man, slowly peeling off some of her clothes and discarding them on the floor. “That’s better...” she slurred. “Can move easier...” Again she giggled and then stepped closer to him. “Mm... I can hear the music Bofwant. Do you like my dancing?” she asked. </div>

With a frown, she looked up at him and in his hand was a glass of water. 

Sela pushed at her wild red hair and scowled. “I’ll practice more,” she slurred. “I want you to like my dancing...” She then took the offered glass in her hand. “It’s important to me...” The girl then sipped the water she’d been given, her head starting to hurt.

“I... I think I need to lie down,” Sela whispered, setting down her water glass and then leaning her weight against Bofwant. Her body felt heavy and awkward, difficult to move and control. “Why am I so tired?” she asked, practically falling against the man, her arms wrapping about him. </div>

When she wrapped her arms around him he took her off the floor, holding her legs with his left arm while the right held her body so his left shoulder had the less strain. &quot;It&#39;s because you are tired, we had an exhausting day...&quot; He explained as he walked them to the bed. He lowered softly and then helped her to remove her clothes so she would sleep comfortably, then he took off his boots and pants, leaving only his underwear and bandages on his bare chest.

He turned off the lights and joined her in the bed, not resisting the impulse and taking her in his arms again despite his aching ribs, &quot;Let&#39;s sleep, tomorrow will be another day...&quot; He whispered softly to her and gave her a final kiss for the night. </div>

He looked tired after making his rounds, normally he wouldn&#39;t be so tired but that last job had triggered some of those bad memories he had of war. It&#39;s ugliness, how the innocent always suffered thanks to the greed of those in power. Still, he had managed to get some sleep but he had remembered his promise to preside over a ceremony for Mors and Irithriel so in every spare moment he could get he had started to work on his speech. His armor had been cleaned and was perfectly on display thanks to the wooden mannequin he had in the corner. He was nothing if not a proud soldier despite everything.

So he was sitting there on the bed in only his sleeping boxers as he worked a little on his words and waited for Sela to arrive before going to sleep.  &quot;... Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil...&quot; He muttered as he wrote the words on the parchment. </div>

The girl knew she’d been more of a burden than a hell on that latest job. Endangering them and their quarry. But hopefully now no more, now she could begin to strengthen her mind, her soul. Oh, if only she hadn’t felt so tired.

In the shadows, Jarreth lurked, his violet eyes wild, while he inhaled deeply, almost as if intoxicated. Truly, it had been worth the long wait for this. He knew the girl would eventually come back to him. She was his and he’d feed on her until there was nothing left, her magic coursing through his veins, making him stronger. A demon to be feared! But he’d only just started. The true delicacy would come later once she fell asleep.

“Bofwant...!” Sela exclaimed happily, closing the door behind her, she then rushed towards the soldier and gave him a sweet kiss against his cheek. Her aura had changed slightly, that twisted scar that had once marred her face... gone. “How’s your speech coming along?” she asked, noticing he was working on it. </div>

His holy senses tingled a little, letting him know that something news different about her but he dismiss it as tiredness. &quot;How? What happened my love?&quot; He asked, curious about it. He pushed the parchment and pen to the side and gestured her to sit besides him on the bed. He knew that he had been busy lately but despite being tired he would always make time for her. </div>

She hadn’t asked for Jarreth’s gift, but the herald had seemed rather preoccupied with making any sort of blemishes or imperfections disappear. Perhaps it was his way of making her strong. Work on the outside, while working on the inside...? 

“I hadn’t planned for it. It just sort of... happened...” Sela explained. Jarreth just watched from his shadows, grinning toothily, as the girl tried telling her <em>lover</em> the dark gifts he’d bestowed upon her—some wanted, others... “Bofwant, I... I wanted to make things easier for you, especially after what happened on that job. I... I talked to the Grand General and I, well, Jarreth is now granting me power.” 

Sela reached for Bofwant’s hands, entwining her fingers with his. “He was the one from my past, my love. That demon that my parents had summoned. I... I’m facing him now. Not running. I... I’ll be a help to you now. Grow stronger.” The girl smiled hopefully, while Jarreth looked on, a malevolent glint in his wild otherworldly eyes. </div>

Then he listened to her words, his brows furrowing in confusion and some anger at himself. &quot;Why?... Why would you think you were a burden? To the point of seeking the powers of others like that.&quot; He shook his head a little but no matter what his hands never left hers. &quot;This is my fault... I was too focused on my own anger against Jericho and what he stands for to see that you were suffering like that. Feeling like a burden.&quot; He didn&#39;t have any issue against warlock themselves. They were no different from clerics in his eyes. It wasn&#39;t about who gives the power but how to use it, those were his thoughts on the subject. &quot;Why didn&#39;t you come to me before?&quot; He started again but stopped himself. &quot;Here I am, only thinking about me instead of asking...&quot; He took a deep breath then and looked looked into her eyes. &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter what I or others think or want....

No... no... you’ve not done anything wrong. I just wanted to help and show you I can be strong too.” Her golden eyes were shining with unshed tears. “I understand full well how poorly I performed when we extracted the Grand General.” A single tear rolled down her now perfect skin. “And I didn’t ask for this...” she went on, her free hand moving to her face. “That was all Jarreth, the herald from my dreams.”

Sela swallowed hard, suddenly worried she’d made a poor choice. Once more proving she wasn’t good enough for this man before her. Broken... so broken! She could never be fixed! In that moment, she felt a nudge, a warm darkness pouring over her like black velvet. It embraced and soothed, whispering sweet, calming promises in her ear. Jarreth. Sela could feel him. He was there. 

“I just long to make you happy, my love. I want you proud of me. I want you knowing I’ll always be there and... and never falter...” Sela could feel Jarreth’s eyes upon her. Upon Bofwant. “In three day’s time, Jarreth promised to show you the contract. You and Grand General Jericho. I... I think you will be proud of me, my love. Like you, I will not run or falter. Never again...” Just then she felt a memory from her past stab into her mind, but she couldn’t feel the smile Jarreth wore the moment it did. </div>

He needed to make her understand that she had done nothing wrong. He kissed her softly before he wrapped his bare arms around her and pulled her body against his in a strong hug.

&quot;I have always been proud of you...&quot; He started to whisper in her ear. &quot;From that moment when I found this woman alone at the top deck, fighting against her own nightmares while still searching for a way to help her lived ones...&quot;

&quot;Since that moment you have fought against that darkness to become better, and even when you feel you were a burden... you were not. Remember what you did for vit? Almost no one is brave enough to risk their life for others who are nothing to them like that...&quot; He remained like that, just comforting her like he always did. He still had questions about her deal with this jarreth, and how she had ended up trusting someone like Jericho but those could wait. He swallowed his pride and let those special senses he had been bestowed to do their work, his awareness to the more expanding around him.

There it was. While not completely there he could feel the strong prescence of a friend within the room. Bofwant raised his eyes and looked at the general direction where he could feel the prescence coming. &quot;I have nothing against you yet... However this is a private moment and it is extremely difficult to hide from a watchers gaze. If sela has need of you or this power you have granted her for an emergency then you can be here... Otherwise I don&#39;t like uninvited intruders in my space.&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Bofwant’s embrace always made Sela feel safe and secure. Warm. But she perked up when she heard him speak out. No one else was there, so why he felt a need seemed strange until... until she realized he was speaking to Jarreth. “Wait... he’s here?” she squeaked, confused and startled. The herald had said he’d be back in three days and with him he’d bring along the contract. So why was he there now?

Jarreth hissed in Bofwant’s direction, his finely chiseled face just barely taking on a more demonic appearance before giving way to those fey-like features once more. His eyes were flashing, and his teeth like pointed needles ready to bite and shred. He glared at the man holding his precious darling, his magic threatening to enshroud the man. Suffocate him. But he could not. The bond between the girl and her <em>lover</em> was too strong. That thorn in the herald’s side. Of course the girl wouldn’t just have a lover, but a holy man blessed with magic of the divine! He let out a roar and stepped deeper into the shadows, his presence all but dissipating for the moment. But he was a patient demon. He could bode his time. It wouldn’t be long until the two went to bed. And with sleep came those dreams. And that’s when he could finally eat his fill.

“But how?” Sela asked, turning to look in the direction Bofwant was staring. Her golden eyes saw nothing. Turning back to her love, she was trembling. “What happened? Uninvited? My love, what did you see?” </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Bofwant felt the spike of darkness before it dissapeared almost completely, only that faint prescence of the bond any warlock had with their patron remained. &quot;He was here, watching us.&quot; He told her, still focusing on his divine senses for a few more moments before he sighed and relaxed. &quot;He&#39;s gone now.&quot; Some patrons could be more intrusive than others... Just like deities could be too. That bitter feeling he had, the one that resented at being forced on this path while his brother became lost at the sea, flared for a second but he shook his head and focused on Sela again.

His hands reached once again for her lovely face so she would look at him. &quot;Remember what I told Jericho? I am no stranger to the ways of the warlocks but I have nothing against them. If you feel that this is your path forward then I will support you and help you move forward. You said that he would show me the contract you made in three days?&quot; He asked her softly. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Sela nodded, nuzzling Bofwant’s hand, as it rested against her cheek. “Yes, Jarreth had said it was done, but the Grand General insisted on seeing the contract.” The girl paused a moment. “At first he refused, got defensive. But as soon as I made the request myself, the refusals stopped and Jarreth had no troubles agreeing to comply.”

While Sela leaned into Bofwant’s palm, she moved closer to him, placing her arms about his middle. “I... I did the right thing... didn’t I?” she asked, suddenly so unsure. An uneasiness gripped her knowing that her beloved had sensed him watching them both. Something about it was unsettling, so she hoped it was merely misunderstanding. “I... I just wanted to help. To do my part to fix myself. Maybe things will be better in the morning...?” </div>

He pulled back and nodded in agreement. &quot;It has been some tiring days for us both. Tomorrow will be a new day...&quot; Then he grabbed her small body and pulled her into his lap, giving her more soft kisses. &quot;...Having to write that speech has made me realize how blessed I am for having you in my life...&quot; Honestly, he was too tired of everything right now and just wanted to spend some time with her, showering her with that love he couldn&#39;t this past days.

&quot;Would you like to hear what I have written so far?&quot; One if his hands moved upwards, his fingers tangling with her hair until he was caressing the back of her head. </div>

As always, she felt that little flutter, the one that only he could cause. “Mmm...” she sighed, relishing this quiet moment and glad to know they were finally alone. No Jarreth. No anyone. 

When Sela pulled away, she felt Bofwant’s fingers toying with her hair. “I’d love to hear what you’ve written, my love,” she encouraged, her heart racing knowing he’d missed her. Though she’d understood his need to help in the med bay, to occupy his thoughts with work, she’d missed him terribly and was so glad he was ready to share time with her once more. 

“Please, share it with me,” Sela said, laying her head against Bofwant’s shoulder, hand still pressed against his. </div>

I may not remember exactly but this was something bhe told me once...&quot; He explained while he kept softly playing with her hair while his other hand kept holding hers, relishing in that special connection they shared.

&quot;Love suffers long and is kind... love does not envy... love does not parade itself, is not puffed up... does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil... does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth... bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things....&quot; He repeated those words of wisdom. The air around them filled with that comforting feeling like every time he did that. &quot;I am still working on remembering the rest... When he told me that we were being transported into a battlefield and the subject came up thanks to the comment a young soldier made about going home and... Getting his live interest with child.&quot; Of course the conversation was way move <em>explicit</em> back then but he always tried to keep those manners he has worked to hard to obtain. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">“Oh, that’s lovely,” Sela said softly. Her free hand moved up to touch his face, gently caressing and exploring. She loved the way he felt beneath her fingers and it had been so long. Her heart twisted a bit, hoping she could now be of help to the man she loved. Maybe now he wouldn’t need to always drown himself in work. Or maybe he’d allow her to assist by his side. Anything for more time. And anything to ensure she didn’t add to his troubles. 

“Well, that couple you spoke of will no doubt love what you’ve put together,” Sela continued to encourage. “They could have asked anyone to officiate—the guild master, even an outsider to the guild. But they chose you and it’s easy to see why.” The girl’s fingers traced Bofwant’s lips then. “They will be lucky having you play such a role for them.” She was beaming, just happy to be spending time with the paladin. Though another part hoped one day to hear similar words when the time was right and her love decided they should properly wed. How he could fall for someone so broken, so full of darkness... it was humbling. And why Sela felt she needed to play her part to face her fears and keep tight reins on the evil she felt festering inside. 

“Are you nervous, my love?” Sela then asked, looking into Bofwant’s eyes. “Or uneasy? Is there anything I can do to help?” The girl just wanted the soldier to know she was there for him. Always there. Never again would her past haunt her or make her weak, unpredictable, dangerous. Never again would she endanger him or others. She would face the darkness head on and push it into submission. She would gain the upper hand. She would never be a burden again.

Elsewhere in the shadows, Jarreth could still feel his connection to Sela. He did not need to be at her side to feel the bond they now shared. He grinned, satisfied at her newfound confidence. It would be that much sweeter, when he feasted. He could already taste it, that delectable magic tantalizingly taunting him to drink his fill. </div>

This was one of those things he had almost given up, this part about just sharing his life with a partner. &quot;No my love... I have done weddings before, a little less planned as this one but it&#39;s not my first one.&quot; He closed the distance between them and kissed her, &quot;Working on this has made me realize how lucky I am for having you in my life...&quot; He kissed her a couple more times before pulling away a little, &quot;Just being here with me is what I need. No worries, no thinking about what happened, just you and me.&quot; Slowly his hands started to work on her clothes, helping her to start getting ready for bed.


After few moments he stoppedand his hands went to her face, looking straight into her eyes before speaking. &quot;One day, when we have freed your brother from that curse, I shall ask properly for your hand because I want you to share that happiness not only with me but with your family and if we are lucky I can share it with my brother...

She loved Bofwant so dearly, the man doing more for her than he could possibly know. Now it was her turn to help ease that burden. “I would love that,” she then answered, golden eyes misty with tears. “You really would like to marry me?” Of course, he’d alluded to as much the day she gave herself to him, a broken girl with almost no true virtue. But he’d seen past those scars to the girl beneath, taking the shred of a gift she had left to give. But now that time had passed, it made her heart light knowing his feelings had not changed, but had grown stronger instead. 

“And we will find your brother, my love,” Sela assured. “With my new powers we will be unstoppable. And soon the two of you will be reunited, reminiscing on good memories of the past.” The girl blushed. “I hope your brother doesn’t mind a new sister...” she added. “I should like having a brother in law one day.

Right now... If for you and me.&quot; He told her softly between kisses.

He wrapped his arms around her body and easily stood up from the bed before turning around and carefully lowering her onto the soft surface. &quot;Unless you are too tired? Because I could use some sleep...&quot; He playfully told her and even made a few fake yawns.

And while she believed what he’d said for the most part, there was another that knew with her pact... there were just some things she wouldn’t be able to do otherwise. She was just an ordinary elf who happened to come from a bad family, which then led to further bad events. But there was nothing special about it or her. Just fate frowning dismally upon her. Still, she’d do her best to think on things some more, and once he got to see the contract, she was certain everything would be righted by then. 

Looking up at Bofwant, she felt those giddy flutters in her tummy. Their lips touching, while their bodies grew closer and closer. It had been far too long. And she’d missed him. And... “Too... too tired?” she squeaked, worry rushing over her. But she soon realized the soldier was teasing her, taunting her to come out and play. With a small smile, she swat at his arm, her body sinking into the softness of the bed. “How can I be tired right now?” she asked him sincerely, knowing he already knew the answer. 

Sela then reached out for Bofwant, her body beckoning that he come closer. When he approached, she would nip at his ear, his neck. Little kisses along his flesh, salty and warm. Him. “Mmm... it’s been far... too long... my love...” she mumbled between kisses, her legs wrapping tightly about his waist. “I’ve missed you so dearly... each and every second.”

Jarreth just grit his teeth. This sickening bond was making him ill and he was starving. He hoped it wouldn’t be long until he could finally drink his fill. </div>

His hands started to work on her clothes again, his need for her growing with each second. It was this what he most loved of her, no matter how awful her past was, she was still a wonderful woman just wanting to give her love and he vowed to himself that he would always take care of it like the invaluable treasure that it was.

&quot;Yes...&quot; He groaned, feeling his body getting impatient and pulled back a little to start undressing her, taking away every piece of fabric separating them. &quot;Now it&#39;s time to take these out of the way.&quot; Thankfully he was practically naked, only his underwear kept him from being completely bared to her. He knew that his path in life meant that he had to put aside his personal desires but in that moment nothing short of a death situation would make him stop from showering this beautiful elf with his love. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Sela looked up at Bofwant, heart pounding, while she felt his hands go to work on her dress. She felt so desired, so beautiful, as he hovered above her and looked down. It wouldn’t be long before the soldier freed her body from the confines of her dress, pale flesh illuminating the private room, for his eyes to take in and behold. A slight nervousness flooded the girl, blood rising to her now flawless face. 

“Bofwant...” Sela whimpered, golden eyes tearing just a bit. She wrapped her arms about him, delicate fingers moving to his underwear, urging he remove them, so that they could become the closest two people ever could. The girl felt overwhelmed in that moment, just completely speechless that someone like Bofwant could love someone so broken... so utterly tainted... And this was why she’d made that pact. To help push down these nightmarish thoughts, to be strong. 

Meanwhile, Jarreth could sense Sela’s uncertainties, those fears that he knew would always eat away at her soul. Heh, the poor girl had no idea that she could never hope to outrun herself. And he’d see to it that her nightmares were his. And... that magic. Oh, she was like a well overflowing with too much water and he longed to siphon off the best of it. That aroma of magic was strong, making his mouth water. Soon... soon...

Finally bared beneath Bofwant, Sela just lied there and looked up into his eyes. She could hear her breaths, her wildly beating heart. “I give all of me to you, my love...” she whispered, those tears finally spilling down her cheeks. This man had a way of making her feel like everything would be all right, that despite everything she’d seen and experienced, she was still somehow perfect. At least in his eyes. Again, she reached for him, hands touching and exploring his body, unable to get enough. Her legs also spread easily for him, allowing the man to see the neediness and desire she felt right then in that moment... and for always. </div>

Always...&quot; He started to kiss away those tears before finding her sweet lips and giving her a slow deep one, showing her all that mere words could never describe.

He was taking his time to properly worship her beautiful body, using one hand to feel her every curve and soft skin while his other one kept most of his weight off her. &quot;I... There are no words... To describe what I feel for you...&quot; He managed to say between kisses before he moaned when a small movement of his hips made his hard member to rub against her hot sex. &quot;Too long we have been apart...&quot; He groaned, pushing his forehead against hers and slowly thrusting his hips to feel more of that sweet pleasure. He didn&#39;t want to rush things but he could already feel his own body urging him to take her, to become one with his love. </div>

“Nnnggg... Bofwant...” Sela rasped, savoring every second. “I... I like you inside me, Bofwant.” The girl clutched at him, urging him on, wanting to be close. “Closer... please...” she then begged, kissing at him however she could. “Never this long... not ever again...” Her tears continued to fall, her emotions strong and raw, her love for the man above her deeper than words could ever dare to describe. </div>

After a few moments to adjust, he started thrusting his hips. Moan and groans of pleasure escaped from his chest, feeling the hot, wet walls of her sex enveloping his throbbing member. He pushed his forehead against hers and his hands went to her face, carefully cleaning up those tears running from her eyes. &quot;I am here now... No matter what happens... We won&#39;t let anything steal our time together...&quot; He managed to whisper to her before his own body&#39;s urges and the encouraging movements of her hips made him to thrust faster, deeper, stronger. Not only seeking that amazing feeling for himself but also giving her as much pleasure as he could. </div>

That voice that brought her calm, peace. She could only hope she somehow provided the same. At least now that she was trying to face things head on, perhaps she could be and deserve it. 

Sela’s breath hitched, as Bofwant thrust himself deeper and deeper inside her, their bodies finally one after a time too long apart. If only she could somehow show him just how she felt, how far reaching her love went. It was overwhelming to say the least. She felt his pace quicken, her hips moving faster to match his movements. 

“Oh god... Bofwant...” Sela groaned, her little clit swelling to the point of unbearable, while their hips continued crashing furiously against each other. “Mmfff.... mmm....” she moaned, legs spread wide, her hot sex hugging him tightly. If he kept this up, he’d have her screaming in his arms, lost in the rapture only he could stir up within her soul. “Make love to me... fill me... I want our souls joined just like our bodies...” Her hips were moving feverishly, the burn of pleasure slowly rising, heating the room. </div>

&quot;I am...&quot; He started to answer her words with his own even if he was interrupted by the unstoppable sounds of pleasure coming off him. &quot;I will... And they are.&quot; He kissed her then, his rough hands finding hers and pushing them against the soft pillows besides her head. &quot;I will never stop... Loving you... Showing you my love... Making love to you...&quot; He managed to whisper between heated kisses.

He could feel her body reactionsnto the rising pleasure they both were experiencing and it made him keep going. At that moment he wasn&#39;t feeling tired anymore. His hips kept moving faster, harder, his throbbing member going as deeper at it could inside her hot sex, feeling that amazing peak come closer but refusing to reach it alone. All his being wanted to make this beautiful woman explode in pleasure with him. </div>

This was a man seeing the girl despite everything trying to hide her true self. “I love you, Bofwant!” she cried, hips bucking wildly, feeling Bofwant’s thick shaft stretching her open, stroking her womb. “Nnngg... god...!” The girl saw nothing but stars, Jarreth seething with hatred, as he felt their bond during this insidious love making ritual. 

Jarreth wanted hurt this man taking his darling Sela. The girl was his now. The contract said so! This love nonsense was only getting in the way, ruining his plans. The girl was to solely depend on him, serve him. It was to be a beautiful relationship... him taking her dreams and leaving her nightmares, siphoning that delicious magic she didn’t even know she had, while her fears and insecurities grew! Damn, that soldier! Damn him to the hells!

“Bofwant... Bofwant...” Sela gasped, her tight channel suddenly gripping him hard, squeezing and milking, pulling him deeper still. Her hands dug into Bofwant’s back for a moment, her delicate fingers then tracing his spine, relishing the shape of him, while hovering above her. Suddenly, her body began convulsing, waves of pleasure tearing through her, while she cried out his name again and again and again. </div>

This was what those words meant, he understood in that moment, and it made him feel even more grateful that somehow, despite all the darkness and pain in both if their lives, they had found eachother.

He exploded with her, falling into that wonderful feeling of release. His body shuddered on top of her, making him break the kiss and gasp of air. He could only give her a couple of more thrusts before it became too much, his hips locked against hers like a perfect puzzle and his throbbing member started to fill her insides with his warm seed, fullfilling that promise he had made to her just moments before. 

It was a while before he finally started to regain control of himself, still feeling her lovely body milking his own from everything he had to give her. &quot;I love you too my sela... With everything I am.&quot; He finally answered, starting to leave small butterfly kisses around her face, neck and shoulders to help her come down from that cloud they both had reached. </div>

They couldn’t get enough of each other, their love so strong. Unbreakable!

“Always yours, my love... always...” Sela sobbed happily. Jarreth hissed where he waited, biding his time. The herald wanted to destroy this so called <em>love</em> between the two. If that soldier hindered his plans.....

“Words aren’t enough to express how I feel...” Sela continued to mumble through her soft sobs. Though as she cried, Bofwant remained close. She could feel his heat. His weight. It was a comfort. One she felt so lucky to have. “Thank you for finding me. Choosing me...” she went on. “For being in my life...” Her legs wrapped about his waist then, squeezing just a little. </div>

Little by little he could feel the exhaustion finally returning to him and before he lost his strength and crushed her small body, he managed to turn them around and pull the covers over both of them.

&quot;From now on...&quot; He started after they got comfortable again with him on his back and Sela resting on his chest. &quot;... We will take days... To spend them together... No work... Just you and me...&quot; He wanted to properly enjoy his time with her, not just give her the scraps of energy he had left after a long day. His arms tightened around her small frame as he continued, &quot;We can cook... Train... Read a story... Or just spend the day in bed like this... Whatever you wish my love. I promise you.&quot; He gathered enough strength to raise his head and kiss the top of hers before letting himself relax once more, already struggling against sleep. &quot;Would you like that?&quot; </div>

Something... special. He was unique and priceless, worth more than gold from any job. Sela relished the feel of being in his arms, feeling the rise and fall of his chest, while he breathed, his heart beating against her ear. It was these moments she cherished so dearly, so glad they would become memories all her own. 

“Oh, my love... yes!” Sela exclaimed. She frantically pressed feather-light kisses all over Bofwant’s chest, hands taking their time to savor and explore. “A thousand times yes. I’d love that. My time with you means more than you could possibly know.” She smiled up at him, her now flawless face radiant and glowing. Though, when the light hit her right, one could see where the scar had once been. That was if they knew to look in the first place. 

Meanwhile, Jarreth let out a roar, anger flooding whatever veins ran through his twisted body. He could feel their love... and the life it also created. He sneered then, trying to focus on the plan. Soon the girl would sleep. Soon his hunger would end. 

“I’ve wanted to dance since that night,” Sela went on. “Do you remember?” she prodded, remembering that first night so vividly. “You, me, the music...” The girl sighed. “It would be lovely.” </div>

His hands had been idly roaming the soft skin of her back, becoming slower and slower until they stopped. It really had been a long day for him, both mentally and physically exhausting. The safety of the ship and the warmth coming from his Love&#39;s body easily lured him to sleep, chasing away that feeling of alarm he had developed after all his years on the battlefield and war camps..

<em>Those will be a wonderful days...</em> Was his last thought before his mind sent him into a repairing and dreamless sleep for once, no memories good or bad to keep him company, just the warmth soft feeling of their love. </div>

Following his lead, she then closed her eyes and succumbed to that slumber she’d been resisting. As she fell into that dream state, body now limp with sleep, Jarreth dared step out from his shadows. 

Jarreth glared at the sleeping couple, his anger directed right at Bofwant. That bastard had done the unthinkable! He loved his darling girl and dared to fill her with life. Already that paladin’s seed had gone to work, bonding with his Sela, tainting her sweet shadow magic with something he found most repulsive indeed. 

With a soft sigh, Jarreth pet Sela’s pretty red head, fingers tangling with those fiery locks before letting them fall along her naked back. With a sneer, he whispered to her. “He will ruin things, my darling girl. Ruin you. Us. He’s taken the best part of you and we cannot have that...” Slowly, the herald’s pretty form began to dissipate, that fair fey replaced by a grotesque horror, a mish-mash of bones and sinew and eyes. His hand gripped her hair and soon he was inside her dream. 

<em>Sela was sitting near a babbling brook, Bofwant on the other side setting up something. Disgusted,  Jarreth didn’t slow his approach. The closer he got, the darker the sky became. Finally, Sela stood up and called to the paladin. But the paladin didn’t answer. Good! Just then, Sela turned, golden eyes settling on the abomination before her. She screamed, hands covering her face, and that was when he pounced! Monstrous mouth latching onto her neck, slowly sucking on that sweet magic, drinking his fill.</em>

“No! no!” Sela mumbled in her sleep, body tossing and turning, a layer of sweat making her forehead glitter. “Leave me alone! Go away! Stop! Stop!” Her shouts grew louder until she finally bolted upright and fell hard onto the floor. For a brief moment, she thought she saw the monster. Blinking, she looked again and it was gone. </div>

Startled and slightly confused he didn&#39;t notice the other presence in the room before it dissapeared. He furrowed his brows as his mind started to function again and he noticed that Sela had fallen from the bed but then laughed a little, still drunk with sleep. 

&quot;Are you alright my love?&quot; He asked while leaning on his arm, using the other to reach for her so she could grab him and climb back on the bed. He was looking in Sela&#39;s general direction but not really seeing anything but the quiet darkness of the room. It was at times like this one that it became obvious that he was just a normal human, no natural augmented senses if one would dismiss the ones granted to him by a higher power. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Sela sat there for several moments just trembling, as she tried to make sense of things. Had it truly been just a dream, or... Or had that terrifying monstrosity actually been real? It had all been so very vivid. And not just that creature, or whatever it had been. That feeling of helplessness, unable to stop the inevitable. And... it had hurt! The girl buried her face in her hands for a moment, rubbing at those golden  eyes of hers. 

“I... I don’t know...” Sela admitted, glancing around for any signs of that <em>thing</em>. Deciding she was probably making too much out of it, she slowly got up and crawled back into bed. Immediately, her body sought out the warmth and safety of Bofwant’s embrace. “Hurt my backside a little,” she added. “Such an awful dream.” Her nose crinkled a bit, as her thoughts kept alive that horrific image. 

Jarreth had gone back to his shadows, that paladin too sleepy to sense his <em>uninvited</em> presence. The herald, once more holding that fey-like appearance, just rolled his eyes. He was amused that the human couldn’t detect him right then, right after he’d... just then, he licked his lips and rubbed his tummy. Truly, the girl had been delicious. A fountain of shadow magic and to think it was all his own! And the dream state was the perfect feeding ground, time being different in the land of dreams versus the land of wakened. Oh, she’d been the perfect meal and he’d be sated... for now. Though it was tempting to drain away a few more morsels merely because he knew he could. But he was a patient demon, after all. 

Sela kissed Bofwant’s chest. “I’m sorry, my love. I... I didn’t mean to wake you. It was just a dream. But I won’t let it burden you. Sleep, my love. Don’t worry about me.” </div>

He closed his eyes, ready to fall back into sleep when her soft words reached his ears, making him frown a little. &quot;No matter how little you think something is... You can always share it with me my love, even if it was just a dream.&quot; He kissed the top of her head before continuing, &quot;Nothing about you is a burden for me...&quot;

In that moment a memory of his past came to him, making him smile a little, &quot;When I was younger and still lived with my brother... He used to wake up in the middle of the night all the time...&quot; His voice was sleepy but there was a happiness hidden in his words. &quot;My vision in the darkness is almost useless, so I used to just lay there on my bed, eyes closed while I listened to him tell me all about his lastest <em>glorious</em> idea of how the perfect tool should be...&quot; He finished his tale and changed their positions so he was spooning her from behind and could grab one of her hand in his. &quot;Feel how perfectly we fit against each other... Even if we aren&#39;t officially joined, our hearts, bodies and souls are already one... No matter how good or bad, big or small... I want you to share everything with me and do the same in return my love&quot; he gave her a soft kiss on the back of her neck and just relaxed against her. Despite his words, he wouldn&#39;t force Sela to share something that she wasn&#39;t willing or wasn&#39;t ready to tell him, he would just be there for her. </div>

Thinking they could ever outsmart a creature of shadow... it was laughable, insulting. It just never would happen.

Whatever it was he had noticed her nervous laughter, her uneasiness, so he decided to pull out the big guns. &quot;When I had to take care of the rescued children... They always had nightmares... And this is what always calmed them down and helped them sleep peacefully.&quot; Even if he didn&#39;t like to use that holy power granted to him, there were moments when even his stubbornness had to be put aside, and even if it wasn&#39;t necessary, just the act of it always helped others to feel safe. 

He moved their joined hands over her beating heart and took a moment to gather the words floating around in his sleepy mind. &quot;<em>You shall not be afraid of the terror by night, Nor of the arrow that flies by day, Nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, Nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday. A thousand may fall at your side, And ten thousand at your right hand; But it shall not come near you.</em>&quot; And just like that, he filled the atmosphere around her with his comforting holy power, casting on her a protective spell that would keep her safe from both evil and good. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Slowly, that warm glow was fading around Sela. Of course, even holy power couldn’t last forever, and as the paladin feel deeper into his own state of sleep, Jarreth knew it was just a matter of time. When he was certain the big oaf was asleep, he slithered close to his darling girl, salivating wildly, as he looked down upon her. She was exquisite, while she lied there, so fragile and naive. It made him feel powerful knowing he now had this endless supply from which he could siphon, a supply he vowed would one day beg him to feed. 

Jarreth slipped into Sela’s dream, watching her body seemingly float amidst nothing. Ah perfect! A dreamless slumber was the easiest to take and control. Slowly, he approached the floating girl, her eyes going wide the moment he was near. But it was too late. He latched onto her mouth this time, slowly draining the addictive magic, his own body feeling stronger and faster by the minute. </div>

The darkness in the room was blown away by the shinning light of his now holy fists. He had no idea how Sela&#39;s patron looked, right now he only saw the naked form of Sela struggling in the lap of an unknown man. In that split of a second he felt all that righteous fury inside him explode and his naked body jumped straight at the man.

He didn&#39;t scream anything else, didn&#39;t think, only let his body react on his own. He didn&#39;t pull his punches like he normally would, instead he unloaded all his power into that single punch as soon as his hand connected with Jarrett&#39;s face, not only hitting him with his now holy fist, but also unloading his holy magic into the most devastating attack paladin&#39;s were known for, a holy smite.

Still running on autopilot thanks to his training and protective instincts, he pulled Sela away from the intruder, pushing him onto the bed behind him and putting his own naked body between her and whoever his creature was. </div>

He was a menace, that annoying pest forever in the way... and he needed to get rid of him! Fast! His otherworldly eyes flashed menacingly up at the paladin, an eerie purple glow swirling about his fey-like body. Just then, the light rushed away from him, hitting Bofwant full force in the chest. 

The paladin would feel that sickening tug only magic from the hells could cause, smothering his holy light with something sinister. Dark. Suffocating. Bofwant would be surrounded by a dark shadow, its tendrils preventing him from moving, hindering his breathing. </div>

Jarreth is here. No harm will befall you.” His voice was like velvet, making Sela nod groggily in agreement. He cupped her cheek, watching her nuzzle his palm and enjoying this little display he put on for that brute. Turning back to Bofwant he sneered. “Do not cross me again!” At that, he disappeared, Bofwant able to move, Sela sitting on the bed blinking. </div>

Even his glowing fists, full of channeled divinity couldn&#39;t even move a little. It all became worse when this Jarreth out his hands on Sela&#39;s naked body.

For the first time in years he felt that gripping fear of not being strong enough, to have let his guard down and allow harm to come to the one under his watch. It filled him with fear and fury, how this thing touched the woman he loved and she let herself be touched as if she was charmed by magic.

Then he finally went away, his dark magic with him and Bofwant was able to breathe again. He gasped and filled his lungs before he moved towards Sela, softly grabbing her face. &quot;Sela! Are you alright?!&quot; He desperately asked her, his glowing hands allowing his common eyes to check her nor any injuries but finding nothing.

Once the relief that she was unharmed came to him, he sat on the bed besides her, fists closed in anger and shame. &quot;Who was that? That Jarreth?... And how... Why did you allow him to touch you like that?&quot; He asked her, his voice breaking a little. Right now everything was just too confusing, his mind barely catching up to such an invasion in the space he thought was private and safe. </div>

Sela you even nuzzled his palm like a pet enjoying the touch of her master...&quot; his voice remained quiet, just relieving the recent events and properly making sense of them. As he paced around, hands still glowing a little, he saw his brother&#39;s armband on his arm, the object that has become his holy symbol.. and it made him remember something important. Unlike his brother, Sela was alright and there with him. He hadn&#39;t failed yet, he could prepare, watch, be better.

He kept speaking, voice not breaking anymore but becoming more secure. &quot;Your parents searched for dark things... Things that scarred you as a child. You keep speaking about this powers... Promises, what did you promised him?&quot; He asked her, finally turning to look at her. &quot;This Jarreth... your patron was here, invading our privacy, violating it again.&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">”Why would Jarreth invade our privacy after you expressly told him not to?” Sela asked, genuinely trying to understand. The fact that Bofwant was so bothered, seemingly agitated, was enough to place her on edge. “Perhaps he sensed my nightmare?” she wondered, speaking her thoughts aloud. “Jarreth can see my dreams,” she explained. “It was the only thing we agreed to. Powers for entry into my dreams.”

Sela went quiet for a moment, watching Bofwant pull on some clothes and trying to gauge his thoughts. Truly her love didn’t think Jarreth was causing issue. The herald had solemnly promised their deal would cause her no harm. Was he truly living up to his part of their bargain? Without the contract, she wasn’t sure. But she assumed he couldn’t have violated it since she could still feel the bond between them. 

“It was a simple ask really and he promised you’d see the contract in three days. So far he seems to have upheld his end of our agreement. I... I can feel him, my love. A sort of link. It is strange.” Sela moved to be near the paladin, needing his touch, his reassurance. “You say he touched me though?” she pressed, tummy in knots at the thought of anyone besides Bofwant coming close. “Why don’t I remember? Is there something wrong with me?” </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Bofwant furrowed his brows at her words. &quot;Your dreams?... Do you know how important are your dreams? They are the way your mind and soul process what has happened to you. Where you create a destroy parts of yourself... A place so intimate that not even yourself can reach most of the time.&quot; He sighed and shook his head a little before picking up one of his shirts and handing it to Sela, remembering that she was feeling cold. &quot;Why do you think Gods speak in visions and dreams? It&#39;s where you are most vulnerable, where your defenses don&#39;t exist... Where you exist as the most pure form of yourself in a way that no one can truly comprehend.&quot; At least that is what the cleric had taught him. &quot;Why would you share a piece so intimate of yourself for power? Isn&#39;t that what led your parents to their demise?&quot; He asked her softly, his glowing hands caressing her cheeks to warm her up a little.

Then he had an idea and not only expanded his senses but concentrated his power in his eyes. Boring brown turning into holy gold, allowing him to see some of what was unseen. He felt it then, that bond she spoke of but not only that. He felt the prescence of that Jarreth, his head turning around and his eyes locking on his hidden shape. Thanks to everything that was happening he missed that little sure if life starting to grown inside Sela&#39;s body. &quot;Show yourself! I can see you watching us!&quot; He would not be scared by some dark being. Even if he had to give his life for Sela&#39;s he would figure this out. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Sela frowned. Had she done something foolish? In her rush to ease Bofwant’s burdens had she actually made things more difficult? From what she heard her love saying, she was beginning to second guess her decisions. She bit down on her lip, body trembling a bit, as her fear and frustration grew. “I... I’m so sorry, my love... I... I didn’t know...” The girl felt her eyes prick with tears, one rolling along her cheek where that scar had once been. 

“It had seemed harmless enough,” Sela went on. “Jarreth promised not to tamper with them. And he promised no harm would befall me. It... it seemed harmless, my love... harmless...” Shame filled her heart, thoughts dwelling on that dark past with her parents, that she so wished to forget. The girl sniffled then, burying her face in her hands, while Bofwant shouted out. </div>

A dark shadow appeared and soon Jarreth stood there in the middle of the room, his otherworldly eyes fixed hard upon the paladin. “Tch... why do you bother me, boy? Save your tricks. You might hurt yourself,” he mocked in a lazy drawl before his eyes moved to settle upon his darling Sela. Without hesitation, he began making his way towards the red headed elf. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Bofwant kept his focus on the being&#39;s hidden prescence despite his heart tugging him to comfort his love, but her safety was first and a watcher never lowers his guard.

Then finally Jarreth revealed himself again and started to move towards Sela. The soldier didn&#39;t care that he was weaker than this patron, he took a step to the side and blocked his path. Not caring about the threats to his own safety. &quot;And I told you that you are not welcome here!&quot; He raised his glowing hand, palm open to push Jarreth away. 

In that split big a moment when he touched the dark being and felt his fiendish nature, he remembered something as if by divine intervention. <em>An elderly watcher offering some word of wisdom in his first day of experiencing the horrors of the battlefield. “The Lord  will cause your enemies who rise against you to be defeated before your face; they shall come out against you one way and...&quot;</em> 

As the memory played out, he felt the holy energy bulging up in a way he hadn&#39;t felt before thanks to his own reluctance. Instead of fighting back like he always did, he let the power flow and finished the old phrase with all the authority he had. &quot;... Flee before you seven ways!&quot;

Then that miniscule space between his hand and Jarreth&#39;s chest, exploded in a very intense light and condensed holy power. Banishing the fiend and sending him running away by his own power so far away that he would take a long while to return.

In exchange for that, Bofwant drained himself of all his holy power and overloaded his own body, having never before handled such an output of radiance before and cause him to feel like his veins were burning. He fell backwards and ended sitting on the bed, slightly blinded and a little stunned in surprise. </div>

That holy energy was suffocating him. Ruining everything! No. He’d waited too long, had planned too hard, for this big oaf to destroy absolutely everything. He wouldn’t let him. He’d hurt him. Break him. His life would be forever altered now. That holy man made the first offensive. And that meant one thing. That meant... war! </div>

That no injury had befallen him. 

“Bofwant...?” Sela whispered, leaning forward then and kissing his lips, desperate for any signs he was all right. “Please be all right. This is my fault... oh god...” She was crying, hands touching Bofwant’s face, his hair. “Why do you both trigger the other? Is it something I’ve done? Oh... I’ve made a mess for us!

He could barely feel Sela touching him, his eyes and arms burned like and he could see some white spots in his vision despite the room being in darkness again since his hands had stopped glowing. Good thing the was no stranger to pain and his hearing had not been affected.

&quot;I... I am alright...&quot; He finally managed to answer her, groaning a little thanks to the burning pain. He took a couple of deep breaths, gathering himself before closing his eyes and letting his body rest against Sela. &quot;I had only heard rumors... The elders told me that it was just like training.... Training to let the power flow, that one moment the divinity could burn me too if I was not used to it...&quot; He managed to raise his arms and weakly hug her. &quot;I will be alright in the morning... Don&#39;t worry... You have done nothing my love...&quot; He whispered to her, even in his own pain he was trying to calm her down but he could barely speak. 

He had dismissed the elders, focused in his physical training since he had never liked to rely that much in a power that could be exhausted in the middle of a fight, just like it happened now, leaving him completely drained... But he also had not let his body become accustomed to it either and that had cost him tonight. &quot;That thing won&#39;t bother us for a while... I don&#39;t care if he&#39;s your patron, I don&#39;t like how he took liberties with you like that...&quot; </div>

He... he knows what you mean to me. I... I...” A tear fell from a glittering golden eye. “Just... why?”

Everything seemed like a mess, Sela’s only concern that Bofwant was all right. She’d need to find out just why Jarreth had triggered her love like this. Something was definitely wrong, and she needed to find out what and then... set things right. 

“I will figure this out, my love. My sole purpose for seeking his help was to avoid burdening you. But... but it looks like I’ve done something horribly wrong. I must fix this somehow.” Her hands touched his face, lips trailing in their wake. “Are you sure you’re all right? What did you do exactly?” she then asked. </div>

He opened his eyes to look bat her but the darkness of the room and what happened didn&#39;t let him see anything, just dark and white spots was what he could see and also felt the aftermath of burning so he just sighed and closed his eyes, letting his head rest against Sela&#39;s hands. &quot;That... That was something I had never experienced before... Only heard rumors about it. Some watchers call it <em>turn the unholy</em>&quot; he answered softly between groans of pain. &quot;A prayer... A channeling of divinity so powerful that... That it can censure any fiend or undead and make them flee...&quot;

He took a deep breath and shook his head, his weak arms tightened around Sela a little more. &quot;It is my own fault that I ended up like this... And that Jarreth, he didn&#39;t respect my wishes... He was here all along... He got aggressive when I blocked his path to you... Twice... I don&#39;t like that.&quot; 

He remained like that, enduring the worst of the pain. It was like that holy power accumulated inside him that always helped him to heal faster... Had been completely depleted for the first time in his life. The soldier took another deep breath and let himself fall back on the bed, taking Sela with him. &quot;You don&#39;t need to figure out anything by yourself... Why would you want that when you have me to help you my love?&quot; He finally asked after a few silent minutes. He was still too upset and in pain to fall asleep again even if he knew that Jarreth wouldn&#39;t be back in a while. </div>

Though his words were reassuring, the girl sensed his actions had taken its toll. As it was, he’d already been exhausted, so resorting to such measures no doubt left him in a most vulnerable state. Her heart twisted knowing he’d done it for her. Placing himself at risk. Willing to endure such pain. Just... why did it have to be Jarreth? Why was her patron doing this to them both?

“I know, my love. I always know you’ll be there. Just as I am here for you.” Sela leaned close and kissed Bofwant. First his cheeks, then his eyes. Finally, she kissed his lips and then moved in to just hug him. “Are you all right to move?” she then asked, getting up and reaching for a robe, something to conceal her naked flesh. She wondered if perhaps a walk or some food might help him out in some way.

“If you are, we can take or walk or get a snack.” Sela rested a hand against her belly, unaware of the life growing there inside. “I wouldn’t mind something,” she admitted shyly. “Though we could go anywhere or do anything. I just want to spend time with you and, since we’re awake, maybe we can take advantage of what the night has to offer.” The girl smiled at Bofwant, her hands extended, reaching for him to join her. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">The man remained laying on the bed, little by little the burn receded enough that he regained the feeling of his skin and could feel Sela&#39;s kisses, which made him smile a little despite that burning pain he was still feeling inside him. &quot;Thank you my love.&quot; He managed to tell her before she moved away to dress. &quot;I can move... But I may need to keep my eyes closed for a little while.&quot; He explained, still seeing some white spots in his vision besides the pain.

He wouldn&#39;t be able to sleep now so what Sela&#39;s proposed was a very good idea. &quot;Yes... A light meal sounds good.&quot; With a grunt of pain he sat on the edge of the bed again, eyes still closed and he reached for the Healer&#39;s pack he always had besides the bed. Thank to his expertise it wasn&#39;t difficult for him to reach for the burnsoothe. While he knew that his burn was not a normal one, the ointment had some painkillers into it and always felt cool on the skin. He rubbed some where he was hurting more, around his closed eyes and his lower arms and hands. Then he grabbed some bandages and wrapped his eyes, he wouldn&#39;t risk damaging them further.

After he was done he packed everything and sighed, &quot;I may need some help finding clothes and walking around... Right now, I am depleted and my body is not healing in a supernatural way like it always did.&quot; He explained and offered a smile he knew she would be able to see through the darkness of the room. &quot;Right now, I am a simple human.&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Sela finished securing the robe about her otherwise naked body and frowned, as she watched Bofwant wrap his eyes and apply ointment. He was in pain. And hurting much more than he was letting on. Not wanting him to worry on her account, the girl immediately took hold of his arm. 

“I will always be your eyes when you cannot see, my love,” Sela stated. Though the paladin couldn’t see her, his eyes wrapped with bandages, her own golden eyes were damp with worried tears. “This way,” she prodded, guiding him gently to the door, and doing her best to hide her fear and concerns. Right now, he needed her. And she would be there for him until she could not. (Exit to <span class="mention">#mess-hall</span> ). </div>
