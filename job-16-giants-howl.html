He was warm and inviting, just what she needed to stave off the chill. “I... I’m all right,” she said softly. “I’m w-with you.” She smiled up at him, her manner like that of a child who wished to play regardless of the weather. Refusing to admit they were cold or uncomfortable. 

Though she said no more, Iri moved close to Mors, pressing herself against him, taking in his warmth. The girl nuzzled her face against him, her cheeks reddened from the chill. “D-do you understand those whispers, my beloved beast?” she asked him. From the look on his face and the way he was repeating the strange sounds she’d heard, she had a feeling he did. “What’s it saying? What’s it mean?”

As Iri waited for Mors to answer, she caught sight of Taff and Warden. The pretty elf smiled, lost in the moment at witnessing such kindness. When she pulled herself from her reverie, she looked back up at her mate again. “Should we be worried? Is it dangerous?” </div>

Of course once he started to sketch the rough map it would only be his ears that he would be able to spare, but now before they began to actually his eyes were also free to look for danger. Of course he did not believe himself to be the best at looking out for danger but he was far from the worse either. The more people doing so would result in the more likely at least one of them would spot any approaching danger in time for them to prepare for it.

Luckily his winter clothes was doing their best to keep out the chill, he did feel a bit cold, but nothing that he could not handle.

They didn’t set well and more so because she just didn’t understand what they were saying, if anything at all. She’d reached for her Mors again when Warden expressed his concern. 

“Yes...” Iri whispered, but her words were cut short. Her Mors was roiling with furious anger, ready to lash out and cut down anyone for any reason at all. Immediately, the elf placed her hand against her mate’s chest. She caressed him gently, her eyes finding his, that unnatural glow coloring his irises, the pupils gone. “Shh, my beast.” The girl moved closer and nuzzled him. “Remember, he will be an asset.” The girl nodded. “What does he mean by savage? Are the mountains speaking to us?”

Irithriel was sure that the mountains indeed were talking to them all. They just had to listen. It now fell on those who understood to make sure the rest of them did as well. She then turned towards Warden. “Yes, I know a little healing magic,” she answered. “I can also speak to animals, though it proves to be difficult at times.” The pretty elf blushed, but her sweet smile remained. “I... I’m fairly good at sneaking about,” she then admitted. “If... if it’s helpful, I can sneak ahead and see if anything is hiding behind a corner or...” Her blush deepened. “It was boring back in the castle. I... I had to occupy myself somehow.” The girl bit down on her lip. “I had to hide. Nobody liked me. But no matter. I will help as I’m able.” She slid her hand into Mors’ and gave it a squeeze. </div>

The girl’s instinct told her to stay low, giving off the aura of submission, letting this alpha wolf know that she was true to her word—she meant no harm. It didn’t hurt to acknowledge who was the strongest either. 

“<span class="spoiler spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"><span class="spoiler-text">I apologize,</span></span>” Iri said softly. “<span class="spoiler spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"><span class="spoiler-text">I do not understand your language. But we mean no harm. We are looking for Primal Point. Surely, you and your pack know the way.

Irithriel’s words were genuine. Though she wouldn’t look the alpha wolf in the eyes, she hoped he understood her sincerity along with their need. The girl also had a desire to pet him, his fur seeming so soft. She remembered her Mors saying he’d get her a pet after she’d told him her story of the foxes. But now wasn’t the time to dream. “<span class="spoiler spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"><span class="spoiler-text">Please...</span></span>” </div>

Especially since the Alpha seemed to be too scared of Mors to approach him, if he could make them fall asleep then the fight would be much more easier. So he focused on his staff while he spoke the magic words and waved his other hand about as he directed the spell in the middle of the group of two wolves and the alpha. A fine purple glowing powder spread over the twenty foot radius landing on the wolves. Unfortunately only one of them seemed to succumb to sleep. Carric noted that these wolves seemed much more hearty then the average wolf as he had expected to send both of them to sleep. After that happened he slowly moved backwards at an angle so that he was right next to Taff and then waited to see how the wolves would react. </div>

Once more, Iri narrowed her eyes, her focus on the wolf attacking her mate. It would feel her anger and her despair, as another discordant melody rushed past her lips, a song just for it. It was obvious when the beast felt the pain and she couldn’t hide her feelings of triumph. But it wasn’t over yet. The elf looked at both Carric and Warden, the latter looming worse for the wear.

Wolf2 did the same, it stood again and shook it&#39;s body, shaking phantom off, then it jumped the dog, grabbing it like a pup and smashing it against the ground, leaving poor phantom uncontious.

Taff looked around the fight, she didn&#39;t know what to do so she just stayed quiet and hoped that the mercenaries were powerfull enough...</div> <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="05-Nov-19 10:30 AM">(edited)</span></div>

If they all managed to get out of this, she’d make both Warden and Juma presents. She was crafty with flowers and sewing, after all. 

Suddenly, Iri felt that strange and unnatural aura. It was her Mors. Her beast. Whatever peculiar power courses through his veins, it was happening then. She watched him strike at the wolf, the pack leader having no choice but to take it. Gasping softly, she then aimed her arrow with her bow and let it fly, the thing finding its target and striking true. 

Biting down on her lower lip, Iri hoped she was making her Mors proud. Proving her worth. Her value, as his mate. More than anything, she just longed for a happy future with the large man. Perhaps this could be part of that journey towards finding that. </div>

The girl had done her best to ensure everyone stayed as healthy, as she was able to keep them. It had been hard work using the bit of magic she’d managed to learn back in the Feywild. 

“Not useless?” Iri then asked of Mors, those cutting words so often said to her by Vae. “I... I did my best, my beast.” The girl blushed, her face alight with a smile. She pulled back a little and gave her mate a sweet look before biting down on her lower lip. “My beast,” she began. “Do you think that large wolf, the... the leader. The one I talked to... Do you think he’d let me pet him, my beast? I very much would like to,” she went on, her blush deepening as she asked. </div>

The girl’s face flushed a deep shade of red, her heart beginning to race. She wondered if Mors understood this or even knew. Finally, the elf just nodded, accepting her fate since she could never deny her love or devotion to the goliath across the way. Sucking in a sharp breath, she gave the wolf another kiss and moved to stand up. She exhaled slowly, as she made her way towards her Mors. 

“My beast,” Iri said softly, shifting so she could be closer to her mate. “ Somehow these mountains know things.” She paused a moment, looking up into the large man’s eyes. “Like Taff, I’m also being tested. I don’t know how or why, but... it’s what it is.” Her blush deepened even more. “We do have another test, he said. But we will be allowed only a short rest, I...” The girl choked up. “It won’t be enough to replenish my magic, I... I’ll be useless,” she said, worry lacing every word. “I... I’ll disappoint. I... I...” Tears suddenly filled her eyes and she cried softly against Mors’ chest. “But Primal Point,” she managed to say through sniffles. “It’s their den. They’ll take us after the final test.” </div>

Stopping her brief play, the pretty elf moved back next to Mors and nuzzled his chest. “Also, thank you for believing in me. For... for being there.” She couldn’t help but sniffle then, just happy to have been found by him. Chosen. Pulling back and looking up at him once more, she smiled sweetly. “I think we all should rest though so that we can be on our way.” The girl then looked to Warden. “Any suggestions on where to camp?” she asked. </div>

It was a bit of magic my mentor had shared. He knew I adored animals, so he showed me how.” The girl blushed. “It took a while before I succeeded.

The pretty elf pouted, desperate for some true warmth. Biting down on her lower lip, she decided to inspect the vast icy space to see if there was anything they could use to start a fire. After some searching, she noticed an area that seemed to have what looked like the set up of a camp fire. The girl giggled with delight. 

“There’s a set up for a camp fire over here,” Iri announced to the others. She immediately got to work clearing it out and getting it ready so that they could use it... and hopefully then find some warmth for the night. The elf knelt down on her knees, using her hands to remove the snow. Once she was satisfied, she stood up and waved her hands. “<span class="spoiler spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"><span class="spoiler-text">Light,</span></span>” she then said in elvish, watching the camp fire suddenly come to life, erupting into a cozy burst of crackling orange flame.

                    <div class="markdown">Carric enjoyed the short respite that the campfire had brought him and he was able to fully replenish his spells because he had made sure to conserve his spell slots so that he would not find himself in a situation where he wanted to use a certain spell but lacked the magical energies to do so. Of course he was intrigued by the fact that the minions had gone deeper into the cave as he had not heard Mors command them to do so. Was this another part of the test or just a coincidence.  The whispering from the mountain when Mors disappeared from view was certainly interesting. 

He looked at the rest of the people and said, &quot;Well I think that we should probably get up and follow him. There is definitely safety in numbers and more pairs of eyes and ears means more chances that at least one of us will notice anything that we need to take notice of.&quot; </div>

Yes. Her heart, mind, body and soul knew what it wanted. What it needed. “Mors...” she said again, her cheeks wet with tears. She held her bow tightly in her hands, her gray eyes scanning the area for her beloved beast. “I’ll find you... we are one...” </div>

She had to find him! Panic welling within her soul, she heard the thumping of the drums, that eerie whisper burning her ears. “Mors...” she whispered, her hand covering her heart, fingers tapping along with the strange pulsing rhythm. “I... I’m coming...” she mumbled, but there was no sign of anything. The room was a dead end and seemed to have been empty for an extremely long time. Confused, the girl fell to her knees, her fingers still tapping. “Where are you?!” she shrieked. “You can’t leave me! We’re one!” She no longer cared who heard. Her love was gone and she was alone. It was a pain she couldn’t bear. Frustrated, she slammed her fists against the ground. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="13-Nov-19 08:17 PM">(edited)</span></div>

After her little cry, she wiped her eyes and glanced about herself, hoping to better understand where they all were. She was confused that they’d been led somewhere that appeared to go no where. At least at a glance. It was strange though, how something so deep in the caves was this well lit. And those sounds. They were just coming from no where. They were everywhere. The girl took a deep breath, her heart pound just like those drums. Slowly, she stood up and looked upwards. Was the light coming from above? Was the sun trying to find them all? The girl scanned the ceiling, while taking steps close to the cavern walls. Her little hands began moving over them, searching for anything, for some kind of clue that there was more than this ‘room’. 

“The light,” Iri stated to anyone who was listening. “Where is it coming from? And those drums? Check the walls, the floor. Maybe there’s something we missed...” she said holding onto hope, her heart still with her Mors. </div>

But one thing was clear—she couldn’t stop looking for her Mors. She sniffled a bit and stood up. Just as she brushed the snow off her dress there was another loud crash. They were trapped now in this large cavern with no where to go at all. Surely this was a cruel trick! But the drums kept pounding—louder and louder—and then the whispers. Iri frowned feeling a loss, but refusing to give up. There had to be a way to conquer this mountain. 

Trying to think, Iri could only recall the moment she’d conquered her Mors. She’d looked him in the eye and called him a fool. Did this mountain have eyes? She glanced up again, light somehow pouring into the space. They needed to go up. She was sure of it. It was just a matter of how. 

“We need to go up,” Iri finally said to everyone. “Does anyone see a way to climb? There... there must be something...” she said, holding onto hope. </div>

If only someone had pitons. “Does anyone have pitons?” she then asked. The girl had seen Evindal use them back in the Feywild. Vae too. They were perfect for scaling rock walls. But it was looking like such a thing might not be available to them all. “How are we supposed to climb up?” The girl looked up at the ceiling, her eyes once more scanning things, though this time focused on the ceiling. After trying to assess things, she noticed Taff manipulating the water she had in her waterskin. The girl went thoughtful for a moment. “Can you control frozen water?” she then asked the blue woman. “Perhaps you you could shape a path with the snow and ice. It is still water, is it not?” She looked at her hopefully. “Maybe you and Carric could make us something to climb... together...” It was a stretch and she knew it. But it was better to exhaust ideas than stand and do nothing. </div>

Chattering, Iri knee her body was suffering. The cold was taking its toll and she was still exhausted from using up her magic. Now this blasted mountain refused to play fair. For a moment she thought on her brother. Vae would no doubt be laughing at her, approving of this horrific torment she was enduring. 

“The mountain got angry...” Iri then said, mostly to Warden. “It needs to know that we are strong. That we’ll prevail.” Just then, she looked to Taff. “You.

She’d have been eaten alive back in the Feywild. She could easily imagine how much joy and pleasure her brother and Evindal would have had. Had she experienced similarly? “Well, your Bors clearly sees something in you. Goliaths don’t just fall in love with anyone. I’ve no doubt he believes you can conquer this mountain. And you will.” Iri huffed and moved to be in front of the blue woman. “So, stop saying you’re useless and start recognizing your worth...”

The pretty elf paused a moment there. Her own words suddenly haunting her soul. She was one to talk... doubting herself most of the time as well. But this wasn’t about her. It was about Taff. “So you can change into animals? Have you ever tried anything that could fly or climb?” she then asked. “Would you try?” prodding and desperate, Iri gently touched the blue woman’s arm. </div>

He knew that there would be enough similarities in order for him to be able to give her some pointers. He thought back to his teacher&#39;s teaching about the different magic casters and remembered hearing about druid&#39;s magic. So he looked and Taff and told her, &quot;Taff using magic is all about how you are able to draw in magical energy into yourself and then how well you are able to mold that magical energy into whatever form you want given what spells you are able to cast. Druids gather their magic from nature so you need to focus on the nature all around you and harness that power into yourself. Then you need to have a clear visualization of the effect of the spell that you want to cast. I tend to find that visualizing my spells to appear like books, quills etc helps me to focus and cast them more effectively. You need to think back to your teacher&#39;s teaching as I am used to drawing magic from the very cosmos itself through applied knowledge. Focus on the feeling that you get from nature.&quot; </div>

It was easier to hold on than she’d thought. Exhaling sharply, she then set her jaw and truly began her climb. It was a long way up. But she knew she could do it. She had to.

Though she wondered if they’d ever made it to their destination. Did Evindal even ask for her? Not that it mattered any longer... she had her Mors. Her mate and beast. He wanted her and found her to be perfect despite all her flaws. For a brief moment, the pretty elf’s heart swelled and she was then suddenly dropped by strange the entrance by the icy hand, a damp heat caressing her face. Warmth? The girl brushed herself off and peered straight ahead, everything within her urging her forward. She looked back at everyone to make sure they’d all made it... they had. 

“I’m moving on,” Irithriel said. “I must find my Mors...” The girl looked back at the strange cave entrance and immediately attempted ducking into the shadows. Confident she was concealed by any potential predators that might be lurking in the strange beyond, she quietly made her way into the cave ahead of the others, trusting them to move on just like she did and for Warden to tend to Taff as needed. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="24-Nov-19 09:13 PM">(edited)</span></div>
