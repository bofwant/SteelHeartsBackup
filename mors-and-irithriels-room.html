                    <div class="markdown">Since she knew she was going to be on board the Steel Hearts for an indefinite amount of time, Irithriel was given a room of her very own—to decorate and hideaway in whenever it pleased. The moment the elf opened her door, she knew she’d made the right decision coming on board the airship. Though her living quarters were modest and not nearly as decadent as it had been with her family back in the Feywild, they were utterly splendid in her eyes, everything she needed or wanted all right there for her. What’s more. It was her very own. 

With a soft squeal of delight, Irithriel flounced into the room and immediately headed towards the beckoning bed. It looked soft and inviting, just absolutely perfect! Not hesitating a moment more, the lithe little elf flung herself onto the mattress, white hair going wild and fanning out on the pillow beneath her pretty head. With a smile on her lips, she began to hum, rolling on top of the blankets and finally sitting up right again. Her legs dangled freely over the side. 

“Just lovely!” Irithriel sung, legs kicking playfully. Again, the elf giggled, her shimmery dress swishing about her legs, while they moved. The girl loved the way the dim light danced against the silky material. At that, she then stood up and began unpacking, setting out her things, so she could put them away. Her gray eyes suddenly noticed her pan flute. Giggling a bit more, she grabbed it and started to play. 

Pure joy and elation coursed through Irithriel, as she played her flute, skipping delightedly about her room. As music filled the air, dress billowing and hugging her curves, she wondered what new adventures awaited her.

He quietly found a space for his belongings amongst her own and began to remove his armor. The girl watched him intently, wanting to see the man beneath. She knew he was savage, his body hard and rough. Someone who’d lived a life full of hardships. She was a startling contrast in every way. Small, pale, delicate. But it hardly mattered. She was his and he’d be her beast for forever. 

“More comfortable?” Iri asked, moving to stand directly in front of Mors. The girl reached out, her small hands resting their palms against his bared chest. Slowly, she moved them across his skin, taking in the feel of her man. Her mate. “I hope you are liking your new room.” She blushed then, her smile sweet and shy and all for him. </div>

It was her fancier dress, the shimmering material soft and blue. “Do you like it?” she asked him, dancing around the room, as though the dress itself was a partner. She giggled as she played. “Perhaps you can take me dancing in it one day, she suggested but then stopped and bit her lip. “You... you don’t have to dance, my lord.

She’d be just as bared, if not more so than Mors. She looked at the man for a moment, finding it within herself to do as told. She was his mate now. So it wasn’t unheard of to gaze on the other. Slowly, the elf began to undress. First, she loosened the ribbons holding the top together, little by little, her chest was revealed until finally her firm and perky breasts spilled out fully into view. She blushed then, shy little noises coming from her, as she slipped each arm out and let the dress pool on the floor about her ankles. Her nipples were hard, forming taut peaks, as she stood there quietly before him, slowly moving to retrieve the fancier dress. </div>

While she listened to his story, her eyes closed and her breath hitched. She was lost in this man and all that was and could be. He was her beast. A savage creature with a heart. A heart that was forever bound to her own. 

“So... lovely...” Iri panted softly, her body pressing firmly against Mors, while he kissed, touched, explored. “Mm...” she sighed, her hands moving to touch his body back in kind. “Thank you... for the most precious of gifts...” she rasped, breathy, husky, desire in her voice. Her fingers then traced along his spine, dancing over roughened skin. Her own body felt warm. Hot. Strange tingles settling right between her spread open legs. The girl shifted a little, nipping lightly at his jaw, her nails grazing his back, his shoulders, until delicate fingers were lost in his hair. She then gave a gentle tug, as she pressed herself even closer. </div>

She then sucked in a sharp breath when he dove towards her body, lips kissing along her heated skin. Lower... lower... lower. The girl let out a tiny cry of pleasure when his mouth found her breasts, lips kissing and sucking, tongue tasting and teasing. It was bittersweet agony, her whimpers getting louder when she felt the graze of his teeth against her sensitive flesh. “Nnnggg...” she moaned, back arching, breasts pushing upward, a dull throb growing stronger between her legs, causing her hips to strain. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Her mind was spinning, a hazy swirl of color, while Mors continued lavishing her body with attention. His mouth masterfully worked her up, her body hot and suddenly aching. Tiny jolts were coursing along her skin and that strange throb between her legs was growing more... more... more. Iri whimpered loudly, at his assault, her body going mad with the onslaught of sensations. Never had she felt anything like this. Been touched. Desired.

As Mors began to move lower, Iri tilted her head so she could watch. He was moving lower still, large hands moving her legs even further apart than they were. A kiss of cool air brushed over her suddenly needy cunt, the tiny entrance slicked with sweat and her juices. She was wet, her body all but begging for something she didn’t understand when suddenly she saw Mors looking down upon her. 

Iri was breathless, face flushed, glistening with sweat. Closing her eyes she could only shake her head. “No, my lord. Never. You... you’re my first.” She paused, turning her head slightly. “And my only.” Suddenly, she felt so very self conscious. Would Mors be all right with this? Would it matter? She wanted this. She knew it. More than anything she longed to join their bodies and finally become just one. </div>

Her blush deepened then, a wave of heat enveloping her body, so she shifted to watch him fully undress. He was magnificent, every scar drawing her attention and further adoration. She wanted to touch them, to know what each one meant, how they made him the man he was. There were stories there. She could feel it, and she longed to hear each one. 

When Mors sat down and placed her hands upon him, Iri gasped. Slowly, she got down on her knees before him, tiny hands encircling his very large shaft. He was hard, yet smooth, the skin like velvet, as she began letting her fingers touch and feel. Slowly, carefully, she let her hands glide along his thick length. Up and down, up and down. At the base of the shaft, were meaty balls just begging for her touch. So she dared to let her fingers trace them until she finally cupped one in the palm of her hand. Curious still, she leaned closer, a tiny bead having formed at the tip. Tilting her pretty head, she let her lips just barely graze against him until finally she poked out her tongue and licked at the salty liquid his body was suddenly weeping. </div>

She wanted to know every inch and understand how best to please him further. Her tiny pink tongue darted out and began to lick, slowly tasting the twitching tip of his cock, while one hand stroked his length and the other cupped his balls. Her tongue swirled round and round that velvety head, her lips finally opening to draw him in to the warm, wet depths of her mouth. She peered up at him, as she swallowed him, her eyes suddenly going wide when the tip hit the back of her throat. She gagged unexpectedly, her throat clenching tightly about his cock, while her eyes watered. Quickly, she pulled him out, catching her breath, while strings of saliva glistened between her mouth and his shaft. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="09-Oct-19 07:23 PM">(edited)</span></div>

Already, her hips were bucking on their own, straining against his grip, wanting what only he—her mate—could give. “Y-yes, my lord,” she whispered, desperate to join with her mate, yet terrified what it might mean for her body. “Take me,” she pleaded. “I...

Though it hurt, the pain could never outweigh her happiness. In that moment, she was giving the one gift she could only give once. And it was to him. The one she was made for. “I’m so glad...” she whispered through tiny sobs, her hips trying their best to move with him. No words could describe what she was feeling right then, a sense of closeness that could never be replicated. Only with Mors could she feel this way. Only with Mors did she ever want this sort of intimacy. Little by little, her body gave in to her desires and after a while the pain became tolerable. Up and down, her body slid along him, his thick shaft filling her to the hilt. He was hitting her cervix, so close to her womb, overcome with emotion, she began kissing him with a ferocity that nearly shook her. “I am made for you...” she cried. “Just you!

She was his now and that meant he had her deepest trust, her deepest love. She knew he’d take care of her in the end. “I... I’m yours, my beast, my savage. L-let me know it, Mors. I never want to forget our first time...” The invitation was plain, her body primed and ready. She wanted this, her hands moving to touch and explore her love. The girl nibbled his jaw, waiting for him to let go, for his passion to finally become unleashed. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">A raw sort of power reverberated in his voice, Mors’ eyes suddenly glowing in a strange sort of way. It was a magic Irithriel didn’t know or understand, but it didn’t matter. This was her Mors, her love. No matter what happened, she knew he’d look after her. She’d never be unsafe again. His hands grabbed her own, her tiny palms sliding against his, while he held her down, pinned beneath his weight, his beast-like power demanding she submit. The girl just gasped softly, body writhing under him, her legs spread, as far as she was able. He was driving himself home, his large cock stretching her tiny cunt so that she took the whole of him within her warm, wet depths. She was certain there was some blood from this brutal taking, but she wanted it. Needed it. Her body begging to be broken by its mate. 

Iri’s body slowly began finding its rhythm, pleasure mixed with pain, while her body continued to adjust to his length and girth. It was exhilarating, everything she needed, her body becoming bruised and sore. As Mors continued his assault, she could feel him striking her cervix, pushing deep into her womb—a claiming. The girl cried out from the pain amidst her tiny moans of pleasure, while his body mercilessly took what was his. Despite the tears streaking her pretty face, the girl urged him on. Ever so slowly, she could feel that strange burn grow stronger and stronger between her legs, her little cunt gripping him hard and pulling him deeper. 

“Nnnggg... Mors...” Iri groaned, her body moving with his, desperate to keep up with his fast-paced rhythm. Her hips were bucking wildly, frantically meeting his with each and every thrust. The sounds of skin on skin bumping and slapping filled the modest room. It was soon was accompanied by its own little chorus—headboard smacking into the wall, while creaks and scratches of the bed frame grew louder, and all of it a result of their love making. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Irithriel was just starting to fully adjust, her body having found its rhythm when Mors suddenly stopped. To most, the girl knew they’d be afraid. His eyes were no longer his, nor was his voice. But she could see through that illusion. She could still see her Mors. 

Mors turned her body around then, Iri Ginter softly, as her face pushed up against the bed. She managed to moved a little, glancing over her shoulder, as she watched him admire her in this very new and primal position. Her hands grabbed at the sheets beneath her, his body suddenly on her own once more. She felt him slam into her cunt, though this time it was ready. It knew how to take him and it wanted it. “Nngg!!” she grunted out, while he took her again and again, his mouth tasting her flesh and then finally leaving its mark. Again, the girl cried, tears mixed with smiles.

“I... I feel you... my beast... my Mors...” Iri was panting hard, bruises forming on her pale flesh. “I... I’m all yours... mark me... take me...” She was sobbing, her little cunt dripping with her juices and blood, her clit throbbing angrily, wanting more and more. As his thrusts grew stronger, she could feel him hitting a strangely sensitive spot deep within, it was then that she started howling in pleasure. </div>

Her little cunt gripped at Mors’ cock, milking him as it clamped down about him, throbbing and heaving with a hard climax. “Oh... oh god!” she shrieked, her knuckles white, as she clutched the sheets, her mouth suddenly biting down on the pillow to stifle her scream. She was cumming. For him. Because of him. Her body giving in to the pleasure only her beast could provide. Convulsing beneath him, her juices everywhere, she let herself get lost in the heightened sensations of her first orgasm. </div>

He was filling her to the point of overflowing. The results of their mess was making itself known all over their bodies. She felt it dripping along her thighs, wet sounding slaps, as Mors rode out his own orgasm. The girl was panting, sobbing, a bundle of raw nerves, when she felt him bite down yet again, causing her to cry out from the pain. Despite her cries, there was a smile on her face a euphoric sound of soft giggles because she couldn’t be happier in that moment. Her body was ready to give out, oh so sore from what they’d just done. As if anticipating this, Mors bit her harder still, pulling her down onto the bed with him, her body fitting to his like that missing piece of the puzzle. She nestled in close, not caring about the mess, the pain a dull ache and leaving a mark she’d don proudly. It was about being with him in that moment. Relishing the fact that, above all others, he’d chosen her. He’d known she was to be his mate. </div>

“No. No one will ever take my beast!” Iri exclaimed, her arms hugging him tightly, while her face nuzzled his neck. “I... I won’t let them!” Warm tears suddenly fell at thought of losing this man and everything that he was. No. No. She could never have that. “I will always want you as you are, my lord. And anyone who tries to alter you or take you from me... just...” It was too much to bear. The thought far too painful. “I’d die to keep you as you are, to stay by your side.” It was a bold admission, but it was also the truth.

She’d pledged herself to his noble cause already. But now he was so very much more. “Yes, my lord,” she said. “Your path is mine now. You will never be alone again.” She smiled sweetly, fingers tracing his scars. “Tell me, my lord, how... how is it you died and came back?” This was magic she didn’t understand, but if it was what made her beast, her Mors. She wanted to know everything. Every tiny detail. He was her beast, her mate, a man who defeated death. And she suddenly felt so lucky to be with him at all. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Irithriel nodded, her fingers still tracing his scars. Mors seemed to have so many of them. She wondered how many were a result of mundane everyday tasks and how many were... her fingers came upon the largest scar. The one running across his abdomen. Something traumatic happened there. Perhaps that had to do with this death he was no longer able to recall. “Oh, my lord,” she whispered, leaning down to kiss his chest. “But you protected the two.” She kissed him some more. “They are alive and well because of your efforts. And one day you’ll get your revenge.” 

It was strange. Iri has never had any care for wars or battles. But she’d also never felt like she had everything to lose if she didn’t. Her family had never cared for her, so her own interests had merely deviated. Now they wanted nothing to do with her, while this man wanted everything. She shivered suddenly, a strange feeling of empowerment taking its hold knowing Mors valued her, considered her something of worth. 

“I’ll be by your side when you get it too,” Iri added, smiling sweetly, as she looked at him. The girl was sighing softly, her body writhing a little on top of him. Mors was touching her, caressing and petting her body, appreciative of her soft, curvy form. “Also...” she went on, fingers moving along the one very large scar. She shifted a bit so she could plant feather light kisses along the mark. “What gave you this? Can you remember the story?” she asked. </div>

Start finding clues on the whereabouts of this man who tried to take everything from you.” Her face was bright and encouraging, her eyes expressive and full of hope. “But first, let’s rest and then later we can have more of that cake.” </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Again Irithriel nodded. It would take some getting used to that someone wanted her this fully integrated into their lives. It was exhilarating and exactly what she’d always wanted out of life. This was what it was like to be accepted, to be loved unconditionally. She smiled at Mors, kissing him back with hungry lips. “And I plan to enjoy our vacation,” she teased, nibbling at his jaw, his ear. Giving him one more peck on the lips, she giggled and got up to fetch the book she’d taken from the library. When she returned it, she’d have to seek out another human fairytale to read—oh the choices there! 

Book in hand, Iri went for the basket next. She made a cute little noise as she set it down on the stand next to their bed. “Our cake smells divine,” she sighed dreamily, reaching for some. She held up a piece for Mors, offering him a taste of the delectably sweet treat. She then took her own portion and stuffed it in her mouth, eyes rolling back, as if she were in heaven. Of course, it didn’t taste as good as her mate. But could anything really compare? She then climbed onto Mors lap and opened the book to page one. 

Iri read for a bit, fingers dancing over the page. She even did voices for the characters this time. “... Lips red as the rose, hair black as ebony, skin white as snow... Over the seven jeweled hills, beyond the seventh wall, in the cottage of the seven dwarfs, dwells Snow White, fairest one of all... Now, a formula to transform my beauty into ugliness... a poisoned apple! Sleeping death! Oh ho ho ho. One taste of the poisoned apple, and the victim&#39;s eyes will close forever in the sleeping death... and they lived happily ever after.” </div>

When she finished the book, he grabbed it from her tiny hands and just tossed it, his focus on her, not the damned book. His lips crashed against hers, tasting every bit she had to offer. Swept up in the moment, she kissed him back, soft grunts, as their mouths moved eagerly, hungrily against each other. She couldn’t get enough. His kisses alone were working her up, making her hot, a gush of her juices suddenly pooling right there between her legs. Her cheeks went rosy, as she pulled away briefly, looking up at him with wide doe-like eyes. Suddenly, the scent of her arousal hung heavy in the air, sweet and intoxicating, a beckoning call to her mate. </div>

But her focus was hardly on that, the dull ache was merely a reminder of just how intense their bond truly was. She welcomed that, her body immediately responding to Mors’ touch. Her mate’s touch. Her little body arched slightly in his hands, her legs somehow knowing to spread, as he brought her down upon his face. 

Mors would see Iri’s delicate pussy, the lips as fair and flawless and smooth as the rest of her features. The moment his mouth was upon her, she let out a low and throaty groan. “Nnnggg... Mors...” Her tiny hands held tightly to his arms, well manicured nails digging into his flesh, while his tongue did its work lapping at her juices. His juices. Their juices. It was as if his tongue knew exactly where to go, stuffing her full one moment, teasing her clit the next. It was bittersweet agony, her body writhing above him, as blissful sensations washed all over her. His reward—her sweet nectar dripping freely from her cunt, for his tongue to taste, his nose to smell. 

“Mors... Mors...” Iri cried, panting hard, as she tried to catch her breath. She was on fire, body melting to his every touch, knowing its mate. Only Mors could quench this throbbing burn, her body instinctively shifting so that her face was level with his cock. Unable to help herself, everything feeling so good, she reached out for the massive appendage and brought it to her face. Her little tongue poked free then, licking and swirling at his throbbing, bulbous head. “Mmm... mmm...” <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="11-Oct-19 06:04 AM">(edited)</span></div>

Her beast had returned, and she knew what he wanted and she was ready to give it. The girl cried out and sobbed when he bit down on her thigh, a mix of sweat and blood and her dripping juices. She was taking a beating, but loved every moment. They could be raw and ruthless, their primal desires filling the air. Never had the girl known such deep seated need. 

Mors’ growls were growing louder, that possessiveness, that need to not just dominate but conquer, coming to the forefront. “Y-yes...” Iri cried, the tears back once again. “Your mate... wants you...” Her breaths were coming hard and fast. “She... needs you... Mors...” Trembling from both pain and ecstasy, she brought her lips back to his pulsing cock, taking him deep into her mouth. 

Slowly, Irithriel began bobbing her head up and down, somehow just knowing what is was she should be doing. It was instinct now. No more thought. His tip struck the back of her throat and she gagged, throat muscles clenching, saliva dripping. “Mmm... mmm...” she whimpered, hungry and needy sounds, as she worked Mors’ cock with her mouth. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Irithriel hissed, as Mors drew her down on his clock, hard. No regrets. The girl just looked down at him, her cheeks stained with tears, her skin glistening from their exertion. She let out a slow breath, her hands moving to his chest for leverage. Her mouth dropped open, her hips moving along his length, and those wet sounds of their coupling filled the room. “Yes...” she rasped, eyes closing, hips moving more and more. He was stretching her, filling her. And her body was now demanding it all. It had learned. It had known. 

Up and down, up and down, Iri’s hips were crashing hard against Mors’ body. Her hands were squeezing him tightly, digging at his flesh, little claw marks left their wake. The girl’s groans were growing louder, desperate. Her little cunt needing for him to fill her with his seed. “One...” she panted. “Always as one...” They’d never be apart from each other now. Not ever. Only death could force her away, but even then...

Iri arched back, breasts jutting forward, bouncing roughly, as she impaled herself on Mors’ cock. Her nipples were hard, sharp peaks standing at full attention. She reached for his arm, placing his palm against one, urging him to touch and feel what was his. </div>

Suddenly, Mors shifted, his mouth on her breast, while his hands grabbed her ever-moving hips. The girl whimpered and cries, the bed rocking beneath the weight of their bodies. She suddenly hoped everyone could hear them, learning that this was what mating truly was. 

Iri groaned louder still, arching back so that her hands gripped Mors’ thighs. His mouth felt spectacular, her senses overwhelmed with sensation and more. “Nngg... nngg...” Her mind was steeled on one thing—her mate, their union, the sweet yet brutal coupling of their bodies and souls. 

Her little cunt was practically heaving the more their bodies slammed into each other. Iri was getting close, her muscles already tightening on their own. “Mmfff... Mors...” she rasped, urgent moans howling from her mouth. “I... I...” She was getting closer, every muscle gripping her mate like a vice. Suddenly, lost it, screaming out in blissful agony, as she fell into a sea of pleasure. She wanted Mors to feel the same, to fill her up, coat her womb. “Please...” she begged, her clit throbbing angrily, while she came hard right there on his cock, her juices a puddle on the bedsheets beneath them. </div>

His eyes were unnatural, her beast. Licking her lips, she braced herself for his mouth, as it attacked her own with full force. They kissed long and deep, her lips swollen and red. “Mmm... mmm...” she sighed, her greed for him rather evident. 

Mors’ seed filled her womb yet again, her deepest, most sensitive spots completed covered in his scent. Iri bore his marks—bruises, bite marks, his cum. She donned it all, proud for all to know who she was. What they were. “Mm... we smell like each other now,” she whispered, her lips moving over his face. “No one will know one without the other now...”’she continued. “As it should be. We are truly one.” </div>

To the innocent onlooker, it looked like she’d been beaten in a brawl by a monster—bite marks and hand prints completely covering her tiny elven body. But she was proud to show things off, to show everyone exactly what had happened between the two of them. Yes, she loved each and every mark. Marks showing she was his. “Mm...” she said softly, her face buried against his chest. 

Slowly, Iri brought her legs closer together, her muscles aching, throbbing. She was sore, tired, and longing to be held by her mate. The girl hummed softly then, Mors keeping her close, cradling her like the most precious of treasures. “I won’t lie to you, my beast,” she said, interrupting her own sweet little song. “I... I do hurt,” she admitted, nuzzling him with the tenderest of affection. “Just... just hold me?” she asked, cheeks red from mild embarrassment. She grinned sheepishly, knowing she’d probably feel it even more the following day. </div>

She’d always know that now and it would always be more than inviting. She felt safe. Happy. Like life had finally taken a turn in her favor. Never had she expected to meet someone she connected with on such a base and primal level. It was overwhelming, exhilarating. And she knew she couldn’t have it any other way. 

While Iri kept close, her head resting against Mors chest and listening to his soothing heart beat, she suddenly smiled. He’d been listening. Though, she knew he had. It made her shiver in delight at just how valuable she felt. The girl propped herself up a little to look down upon her mate, her eyes saying everything—that she loved and adored him, that they were one...whole, that he was her entire world from beginning to end and beyond. 

“What was so useful about them, my beloved beast?” Iri asked, curious to know more of Mors’ mind. She enjoyed their intellectual talks over fairytales. It was becoming a little tradition between them, she knew she could easily get used to. Especially when they lied there together in each other’s arms. While she waited for his answer, she moved to nuzzle his neck, trailing light little kisses along it, her fingers just dancing over his chest. </div>

He pulled her close to his chest, her body easily molding to his. She nestled close, her head upon his arm, their bodies entangled together. Her face went hot and she giggled softly, though it turned into a gasp. The girl hadn’t realized exactly what she’d been doing, letting instinct lead the way for a while. But Mors was right. He was large and powerful and her little body already needed to recover. 

Enjoying his warmth, Iri nodded when Mors resumed their talk. He was right. And she liked that his comments made her think in a way she hadn’t before. “I... I never thought about that,” she admitted, a pretty blush sweeping along her face, her body. “But you’re right.” She sighed softly then, happily. “Mm... you taught me something new, my beloved beast.” The girl glanced over her shoulder so she could look Mors in the eye. She smiled at him, cheeks rosy. “I like learning new things.” Unfortunately, her family never bothered to realize as much. She’d been an observant girl, learning how to dance in the shadows, as much as she did the sunlight. If they’d asked, she’d have quietly moved through the courts, gathering them information. All she’d wanted was a kind word. Appreciation. Love. No matter. She had all she could want now. Now that she’d found her one. </div>

To never talk or comment.” She sighed heavily, saddened that her family found her to be a burden, disgraceful. A nuisance. “I wanted everyone to smile and enjoy life. But they wanted me to marry while they planned how to maintain their elevated status within the noble courts of the elves back in the Feywild. I... I had other ideas.” She smiled at Mors. “I studied music and dance. Everyone said I made a spectacle of myself. That I was an embarrassment. Eventually there were whispers within the courts that I was the ‘wild princess’. Unable to be controlled or tamed.” Her eyes watered, so she wiped away the tears before they could fall. “They left me,” she went on. “Our family had to journey to another family’s estate and when I woke.... they were gone. No signs of struggle.” She paused, sucking in a sharp breath. “I tried to find them but their tracks were hard to follow and eventually I lost the trail. But... but I tried. I’d gotten upset then and I ran and ran.” Iri stopped a moment and looked up at Mors. “I tripped on a root and tumbled a little and eventually found myself here. I had no more family or prospects. No one was looking for me. And... I needed something. It’s how I ended up on the Steel Hearts.” </div>

She looked up at Mors and nodded, knowing she had a lot to learn, but that she’d be learning with the help of her beast. It was nice to know she was loved with such deep ferocity. She’d never doubt him. Not ever. 

“Marry?” Iri stated, more than asked. She was a bit surprised he’d never heard of the ritual. It was common enough amongst most races, even if the rituals differed. The meaning was still one and the same. “Well, with my people, especially those holding status such as my own family, the female is presented to the chosen male and given to him, as a gift. Some do this out of love, others out of whim and fleeting fancy. Still others, like my own family, did so to ensure station and status. I hadn’t been given the freedom to choose,” she said. “But no one wanted me either,” she added. “It greatly upset my parents and my brother made sure to let me know that my undesirability was a burden to them all.” She went quiet after that, just snuggling deeply within Mors’ arms. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Mors’ words made her feel special. Loved. Like she was worth something and actually mattered. It made her feel pleasantly warm inside, her body tucking itself within the safety and strength of his arms. Turning slightly, she looked up into his eyes, once more glowing in that strange unnatural way. She wondered if that frightened others. Did it? For reasons she couldn’t explain, she wasn’t. She could never be frightened of her beloved beast. 

Iri gave Mors a small nod. “In a way, I suppose we are,” she said softly, blushing. “Usually, there’s a ceremony and sometimes even a celebration. It’s a proclamation to others that you’ve joined as one with another. A statement, I suppose.” Her expression went thoughtful. “But if you strip away all those formalities then... yes, yes we are.” The girl had grown up in a world where formality and tradition had been the way of things. Marriage was hardly ever about love, but security of station and status. She was glad no one had wanted her. To have been forced into such a life would have destroyed her spirit, the very person that she was. 

“Though there is usually a gift, much like in your tale,” Iri went on. “Traditionally, it’s a ring, a symbol to others that you are taken.” Though the girl much preferred her bruises and bites. Those said far more than any piece of jewelry. And the gifts Mors had mentioned his own grandparents had exchanged seemed far more valuable than land or riches. It was as if all the pomp and show she’d known belittled what it all truly meant. And it upset her. “But I think it depends on the pair. Others will never question whether I’m taken or not,” she said with confidence, smiling brightly up at her mate. </div>

Our ballad. It’ll be the song that starts when we became one and continues on forever.” The idea of putting their life to song, as they grew older together, forging on in life, having... children. She bit down on her lower lip then, her head tilting to look at her smooth and very flat belly. Her hand moved to touch it. One day she would bear Mors a child. Several. The thought warmed her, her heart fluttering as it sped up in her chest. 

“Would you... would you like that, my beloved beast?” Iri asked of Mors. Her hand was idly rubbing her tummy, her thoughts drifting to the day they’d become parents and bring their young into the world. “I’d very much love to give you that,” she said. Though they’d not been together long, she couldn’t imagine being without him. Nor did she want to. She moved to kiss him then, returning his earlier display of affection. “Our young will be the most beautiful creatures the world has known,” she whispered back. “I long for the day we get to meet them.” <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="12-Oct-19 03:06 PM">(edited)</span></div>

A song,” she said softly, sweetly. “Though no. It’s not a custom of my people or anyone I’ve known for that matter.” Her blush deepened more, her body as rosy as her cheeks. “It... it’s just something I want to give you. Something that we can give our future generations. A gift that never dies.” She averted her gaze then, her smile broadening. “It’s probably a silly idea,” she went on. “But... but it’s something I want to give.

They were a mess and needed to get themselves cleaned up. “There’s a bathing area,” she said softly, trying to move and sit up. Her muscles ached, legs sore and tired. Again, she giggled. “I... I think I might need some help,” she admitted, knowing she’d never be able to walk the whole way. A part of her was embarrassed, but she’d rather her mate know the truth. “But a bath would be heavenly,” she said. “So let’s go find it.

The two had been relaxing and enjoying what the airship had to offer, spending all their time together, learning about the other. The girl had also taken to reading her beast her various fairytales, the two often discussing the story after she’d finished. It was perfect. He was perfect. 

“Oh my beast,” Iri began, her voice a lilting melody. “Please take me dancing tonight?” she begged. “I have a pretty dress all picked out for it.” She giggled then, poking her mate gently, hoping he’d agree to take her. </div>

She threw her arms about her beast, hugging him tightly and planting feather light kisses of gratitude all along his jaw. “Mmm... thank you, thank you, my beloved beast!” she exclaimed. Elated, she jumped out of bed and pulled out the dress she indeed had tried on for him all those weeks ago. 

“Mhm... yes!” Iri replied rather excitedly. She spun around with the dress in her arms and clutched tightly to her chest. When she started to get dizzy, she stopped and stumbled just a bit, letting her tiny body almost fall onto the bed. Again, she was giggling, letting the dizziness slowly wear away. “I hope you approve of me choice.”

Not delaying, she pulled off her nightdress and slipped the shimmery dress on over her body, the liquid-like material draping along her curves in just the right way. Iri sighed and then looked to Mors. “Do you like it?” she asked, smiling brightly with rosy cheeks and wide, hopeful eyes. He was taking her dancing! She was beyond excited for this, especially given the way their first dance had gone. So the gesture meant more to her than mere words could ever express. </div>

Iri was practically purring, as Mors pet her, his fingers moving gently through her thick snowy hair. “Mm... yes, my beast,” she answered, moving then to assist him with his armor. Her eyes showed both her love and her desire. It was obvious both ran deep.  As she situated the armor, readying it for her Mors, the girl let her hands run lovingly along his arms, his chest. 

“Your muscles are tense, my beast,” Iri commented, her nimble fingers caressing his muscles, kneading and squeezing. “Perhaps this is my beast trying to tell me something?” she prodded, teasing him just a little. She moved closer then, her silk covered body pressing against him, while she tested more of his muscles for signs of tension. Her hands opened, palms splayed over the muscles of his chest. “Tell me, my beast,” she went on, her body fully against his now, hands gently massaging. “Is everything all right?” </div>

“No, my beast,” Iri answered truthfully. The girl had never seen actual war or bloodshed. The only suffering she knew was being ignored, shoved aside. Feelings of worthlessness, as they gripped her heart and squeezed. “I have not. Though I think my family had been preparing one when we left on our journey. Perhaps that was why they left me. Maybe they’d hoped the enemy would have swooped in and taken me far away.” 

Iri sighed then, her hands working to straighten things out now that Mors was dressed. Ready. “Are you planning to end our vacation?” she then asked. “Do you have a conquest in mind? Do you... do you think I’ve the potential to... help?” </div>

He might seem big and gruff and maybe even mean. But to her, he was a light showing her the only path she could ever wish to walk upon. He was her love. Her everything. And she’d always know the sweetness her beloved beast carried inside. 

Irithriel then blushed deeper, shy yet proud little sounds resonating in her throat. She loved how her Mors saw so much potential in her and wanted her to be with him, involved, every step of the way. Though she worried about her inexperience, didn’t want it to hurt or hinder. “Oh... my...” she gasped, smiling. “I... I’d need training, my beast. Would you train me? Help me become ready so that my aid is at it’s best?” She knew it’s would be hard, but she found herself giddy and eager. With Mors by her side, she could accomplish anything. </div>

She could feel every inch of him against her, the thin silk allowing her body to take in his heat. The girl nodded then, eyes fixed onto his. They were unnatural, something she was quite used to by now. When he released her, she could still feel the searing warmth of his hand lingering on her backside—goose bumps forming all along her her flesh. She bit down on her lip and quickly readied herself for their evening, a sweet treat she knew he was doing for her.

                    <div class="markdown">“Oohh! I get eight!” Irithriel exclaimed, watching Mors remove his armor. Her expression turned thoughtful. He’d explained that she could kiss him anywhere and now... now she had eight. Blushing, the girl moved in front of her mate, kneeling before him and still in her fanciest dress. She looked up at him, her hands moving to rest on his massive thighs. Slowly, she moved to stand up, her lips finding his, giving him a long and loving kiss. “That’s one,” she said softly before moving to each of his cheeks. “Two and three.”

Irithriel sucked in a sharp breath, her mouth then moving to gently kiss at his neck. Her lips were soft, eagerly kissing and tasting. Her body was responding, that dampness growing between her legs, her scent filling the room. “Four,” she whispered, falling down to her knees. She pushed up his shirt, her soft palms running along his bare chest. Her eyes finding his, she leaned forward, her lips suddenly kissing Mors’ chest and working their way down. “Five.”

Iri could feel her little cunt growing needy now, slowly pulsing, as her arousal grew. With a soft moan, she began working to unfasten his pants. Springing free Mors’ cock, she felt her clit begin to throb, her juices dripping along her thighs, a sign of her desperate need. She placed her hands around his shaft, stroking gently before rubbing her lips against his weeping tip. Slowly, she took just a bit into her mouth. A deliberate tease. “Mmm... six...” she whispered, looking up into Mors’ eyes. “How shall I use my last two, my beast?” she then asked. </div>

She moved ever closer and finally took him into her mouth. Inch by agonizing inch, she drew him in deeper and deeper until suddenly she gagged, throat muscles clenching. She pulled him out then, her breaths hard, her scent now heavy in the air. “Seven,” she rasped before taking him into her mouth yet again. She sucked and slurped, moving to all fours, as she went down on him right there while on the floor. </div>

The girl looked up at Mors, body flushed and glistening, his cum covering her pretty face. Something dark and primal had taken over. She knew it, felt it. He was all beast and no longer the man. As her dress turned to ash, her body as flawless as ever, she licked her lips and nodded. Her voice caught in her throat, along with her breath, as she crawled on the floor, still on her knees before him. 

“Yes, my beloved beast,” Iri finally managed to whisper, head lowered in perfect submission. She leaned forward onto her elbows, backside up in the air. “Y-yours, my mate, my love.” She was trembling, ready. Thrilling delight settled deep in her core, her little cunt presented to her Mors. The tight hole was pulsing in need of him, dripping with her juices, while it quivered, her scent permeating from it and wafting up to his nose. </div>

She could feel her body aching, while her hot little cunt started dripping, a sign of her heavy arousal. 

“Y-yes, my beast...” Iri whimpered, panting hard, trying to breathe. She could feel Mors on her back, his weight welcome despite the brutality of scene. He was working her up, staking his claim and soon he’d mark her womb. “Nnnggg...” she moaned, her throaty sounds making their way to the halls of the ship. “Mors...” she pleaded, her slicked sex gripping him tighter and tighter. It wouldn’t be long now. Her clit was throbbing hard. So close. So...

Suddenly, Irithriel screamed out, her little body convulsing beneath her mate’s. Her inner muscles were undulating, trying to draw Mors deeper still, her body wanting to be marked. “I...

The girl turned a little, Mors weight so warm and welcome, as he lied on top of her much smaller body. “I... I love you too...” she answered, her gray eyes tearing up.

                    <div class="markdown">Iri could feel the damp pooling of Mors’ seed mixed with her juices dripping between her legs, along her inner thighs. It was just part of the aftermath, a sign of their love making and devotion. And the elf welcomed it. She then groaned softly when she felt him finally pull out, leaving her little cunt empty, while it continued to pulse its pleasure, her body sore yet feeling so very sated. His voice changed then, his arms reaching for her, pulling her close like she was the most precious thing in the world to him. 

Feeling loved, Iri looked up at her Mors and nodded. “Yes, my beloved beast,” she whispered. Fresh bruises dappled her little body, a stark contrast on such pale and flawless skin. “I’m all right. I’m always safe when I’m with you.” She nuzzled him affectionately, his tender tone making her feel precious and treasured. It was his way to shower her in the sweetest affection, placing her at the center of his attention. Especially after a more brutal coupling. The girl never doubted that he cared, that she was more than just some thing to claim and use. No. She knew how much she meant to him and he meant just as much to her. It was both frightening and beautiful and probably not something most could see. But then, she didn’t need the approval of anyone. 

“Mm...” Iri sighed, while Mors pet her lovingly. “I love you so dearly, my beast. You are the world to me.” They were bold words, genuine. She’d never loved so deeply, so wholly. How her family could’ve wished her such an unhappy and unfulfilling life with Evindal was something she couldn’t understand. She’d have wasted away, been silenced and stifled, her spirit utterly broken. But with Mors. She knew he saw her as more. She was his mate. His partner. They talked and even danced. He listened. 

Suddenly, Iri was struck with an overwhelming sense of emotions, her gray eyes tearing up. She looked up into Mors’ eyes and smiled. “Happy tears,” she explained and then leaned close to kiss him. </div>

Their hearts beat as one, his eyes even with that unnatural glow saying what words could not. She hoped he knew the same of her. If only there was a way for him to experience all this through her own eyes. 

“I’m glad you shared that with me,” Iri said softly, sweetly. “I like learning things about you, what made you as you are. I’ll add this to our song.” She blushed then, her hands tracing along his spine. “Our sharing and talks together are so precious to me,” she then admitted. “It’s nice learning from another, but knowing they wish to learn from you too.”

Iri hugged Mors again, pressing her body close. She loved how well they fit together despite their many differences. Pulling back again. “You are my love,” she then said, no hesitation or uncertainty present. “Everything you share with me or do with me is the more precious than any dress or jewel. Nothing could replace you. I... I’d rather die if I could not be with you forever.” She squeaked then, burying her face against Mors’ chest. </div>

The dresses were mere things and nothing compared to her time with her mate. Yes, she enjoyed the indulgences and always would, but... even for a partially spoiled princess, some things were just far more important. 

“Ohh!” Iri exclaimed. “The foxes!” She pushed her white hair out of her face and nodded. “Yes. There was a family nearby my home, and I oftentimes played with them.” Her smile broadened then, the memory a fond one. “My mentor noticed and eventually taught me to speak with them. Oh, it was delightful!” Her expression turned dreamy. “They cannot talk like you or I. More thoughts really. Feelings. But it was enough for them to understand my own thoughts and feelings in return. It... it was lovely, my beloved beast. Those little foxes were so dear to me. I hope they are all right.” </div>

It was hard to tell since the little darlings were always playing and making mischief. She knew their antics bothered Mors at times, but she understood why the sweet little things played as they did. Having grown up as she had, needing that freedom, but having it taken away... it warmed her heart that her beast just let the little dears be themselves. It was obvious how much he cherished them, despite his show of frustration. 

“They are sweet,” Iri commented about Mors’ minions. “I know they are troublesome, but they adore you and just want some of your attention. I... I can hardly fault them there,” she said with a giggle. “Mm... really? A fox?” The elf nuzzled his chest, her arms wrapping about him, while she let herself melt against his body. “I would so love that!” She was giddy with excitement, the idea filling her with such elation and happiness. “Thank you, my beloved,” she said softly, looking up at her mate with a sweet smile and glittering eyes. </div>

And while she’d been prone to laugh and play, she’d have aided them all in a heart beat if it had truly ever mattered. It... never had. Even when she’d tried to infiltrate the courts on her own, playing the role of spy, it was never taken seriously. Instead she’d been brushed off. Dismissed. But not by her Mors. 

“I’ll train with you, my beloved beast,” Iri then said, nodding, smiling. The girl had no idea how to fight, but she’d try. For her Mors. For them. “I’ll do my best,” she added. “I’ve never been on the battlefield before. “Will you help me, my love? I know I’ll need it,” she admitted, her pretty face pink with mild embarrassment. </div>

But knowing she’d have her beast with her every step of the way was all she needed. She’d learn and try and do. It was an odd though wonderful feeling to have one you loved believe in you, consider you worth the time and effort. Truly, her home was now wherever Mors was. It wasn’t a place. It wasn’t blood. It was her Mors. 

Looking up into Mors’ eyes, Iri could feel her face growing hot. His large hands pet her, while his eyes just watched. She could sense his love, his pleasure. It made her tummy flutter, her smile only growing. Suddenly his mouth was on hers again, lips moving and tasting. “Mm...” she groaned against him, her lips parting easily, allowing him full access to her mouth. Her tongue found his, swirling and tasting. She was left breathless, arms wrapping tightly about him, as she cuddle close to the only man she could ever love. 

“Thank you for believing in me,” Iri whispered, nipping at Mors’ jaw. “No one ever has before you.” Body bruised, the girl looked into his eyes, smiling brightly. “Tell me, my beast. How did one such as me manage to conquer you?” She wanted to hear it, needed to. Eyes wide and hopeful, she brought her hands up to gently caress his face. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">The smile still played on Irithriel’s lips, as she looked deeply into her Mors’ eyes. She loved him, and so completely. It was hard to remember her life before sometimes. Her blush deepened, and she just relished the feel of his strong hands upon her, gently touching and appreciating. She nodded then, the softest of giggles escaping. Her own hands touched his face, his arms. His chest. She was soft, sweet curves to his hardened lines. Her beast. Her mate. Her love. 

“You... you would’ve been a fool if you’d walked away,” Iri whispered, her eyes searching Mors’. “You are mine. I am yours. We are one.” His mouth was teasing her body again, making the most of their honeymoon together. “And... and I’ll always challenge you, my beast. To me, you’re not evil. You’re my love. The piece that completes me.” She groaned softly when his mouth reached her neck, head lolling back to give him access to the sensitive flesh. 

Finally, Mors’ lips found hers again, kissing his mate... wife? Yes. Wife. Iri knew she was all those things and more. Her hands gently caressed his back, her body molded into his, while their lips and tongues returned to their lusty dance. “Mm... my Mors. Mine...” she whispered. “I love you, my beast... always.” </div>

My best strength pales in comparison to your own, so I want it at my best. For you. For us.” She nodded then, her decision made, though she hoped she did not disappoint her mate. “I know when I’ve lost before I’ve already begun. Please, give me a day. Maybe two. Then, we will begin training. I’ll do my best for you,” she promised. “Now, I need rest. Your warmth and love.” She gave him a shy smile, cuddling close, her arms wrapping tightly about him. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">His embrace was something Iri would always cherish and welcome. Whenever Mors wrapped his arms about her tiny elven body, she knew she had nothing to fear. With him, she’d always be safe and protected. Warm. Loved. Whole. She allowed herself to be wrapped up in her mate’s warmth, knowing sleep would soon take them both. 

“Of course, my beloved beast,” Iri said softly, sweetly. With a small smile, she began to sing. The tune was a new one, the lyrics about a goliath and his elf, an unlikely pair meeting in the strangest of places, and despite odds being against them, unexpectedly finding love. Through their differences, they found understanding, which then led to acceptance and finally completion. They had a larger story to tell now that they’d found each other, but every good story needs a beginning. 

As she sang, Irithriel’s hands touched and caressed her Mors. One hand made its way to his hair, slim fingers massaging his scalp and tugging gently at his locks. The other just traced the lines of his chest, her pretty head resting against his arm. </div>

Her face flushed a pretty shade of pink, a smile playing on her lips. 

“Morning my beloved beast... mmm...” Iri whispered, her body easing into Mors’ touch. It always felt good when his hands explored her, drinking in what was his. “Feels nice...” she then said encouragingly, her backside wiggling against his crotch, while her own hands began to gently caress his arms. “Sleep well?” she then asked, before softly moaning once more, as Mors’ touches began awakening her body. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="23-Oct-19 04:41 PM">(edited)</span></div>

I’m glad, my beast,” she whispered, her body arching, when his hands moved to pet her breasts. They were always so sensitive and responded any time he chose to touch them. A part of her wondered if he enjoyed her reactions. She was certainly enjoying his, when she felt him grow hard against her. There was something thrilling about knowing she could invoke such a reaction from him—an ominous beast to most, but she knew under it all was that heart of gold, that soul which made her heart sing. “Nnnggg... my beast...” she rasped out, breaths coming hard. “Your touches are enough to excite me...” At that, her legs spread a little and she felt his massive length start rubbing against her sex, already slicked thanks to the attention he’d already been giving her body. </div>

No matter how much time she spent with her beast, he always made her feel giddy and new. It wasn’t hard to know without doubt just how much he loved her and only had eyes for her. “Nnnggg... Mors...” The elf nipped at the Goliath’s jaw, leaving a trail of feather light kisses all over his skin. But her lips were back against his soon enough. She parted her lips, welcoming his tongue, as she desperately searched for his. Hungry. Needy. In love. “Always one, my beloved...” Her hips thrust faster, needing for him to stretch her, fill her up. Her body longed for his mark once more, to be coated in his seed, his scent. It knew what it wanted, needed. And it wouldn’t stop until it was thoroughly sated. “My sweet mate made just for me...” </div>

Her body was being assaulted with sensation, getting riled and more excited, that she thought she just might burst. “Nnnggg... Mors...” she moaned, her juices gushing onto his hand, as he mercilessly teased her throbbing clit. It was aching terribly, her cunt starting to pulse, as the pleasure was building to unbearable heights. “Mors...” she panted, her body going taut, as it teetered on the edge. But soon, she was falling down into that abyss. That deep well of carnal pleasure only her beast could provide. At that, the elf screamed out, body convulsing, while her juices continued to gush heavily, as she came. “I’m cumming, my beast... can you feel me... can you...?” She could barely breathe, sweat trickling along her chest making her entire body glow prettily in his arms, while her cunt undulated about his cock. </div>

She belonged to him and only him, just as he belonged to only her. “I love you, my beast!” she cried out, her body taking everything he was giving. After a bit, her body began to slow, breaths coming easier, though her cunt continued to pulse hard about his cock, not wanting to miss a drop that was weeping from his body into hers. Hearing Mors’ growl, she turned slightly, to nuzzle him back, her lips finally finding his for a warm and sensual kiss. </div>

Her fingers touched the sculpture, making her shiver happily in his arms. “Oh, I love it!” she cried. “It’s beautiful. That old fairy magic from my home.

She gasped softly when Mors gripped her hips, pulling her closer, once again his cock teasing her right entrance. The girl just looked up into her mate’s eyes, completely transfixed, while she nodded. “Yes, my beast,” she then whispered, the heat emanating from him swallowing her whole. His cock was hard and ready, sliding perfectly against her slicked up sex, wet from her juices and his seed. 

Irithriel let out a low groan, Mors’ kisses once more working her up. Her scent was growing heavy in the air, her arousal quite plain. Shifting a bit more, her legs spread further and she felt his tip resting against her right entrance. Grabbing his shoulders, the elf leveraged herself just enough so that she could slowly start to descend down onto his primed and ready cock. 

As Iri lowered herself, those lewd wet sounds reached her ears. That sound telling everyone her body wanted his, that they were fucking, making love. That they were once again... one. “Nnnggg... my beast...” she rasped, eyes rolling back. Once he was fully inside her, her hips rolled against his, slowly beginning to rock back and forth. It was a slow and teasing rhythm, yet one full of promise and satisfaction. 

“Then feel more of me...” Iri whispered, her breath hitching, as her pleasure began to grow, her clit twitching hard, as it swelled and engorged. “Feel how much my body needs yours...” </div>

                    <div class="markdown">With a soft grunt, Iri landed upon her back, the bed soft beneath her. She could feel the weight of Mors’ body, as he looked above her, his eyes holding that familiar unnatural glow. Her legs spread wide, his cock still buried inside her cunt, those muscles sheathing him like a second skin. Her beast was the animal again, something the girl always longed to see. 

“Nnnggg... yes... I feel you, my beast...” Iri rasped, her body arching up to meet his. Her breasts bounced roughly for him, her hardened nipples rubbing against his chest while those fleshy mounds jiggled and swayed. Her legs then wrapped about Mors’ waist, hips bucking wildly, as her pleasure grew stronger and stronger. 

Iri couldn’t help it. She was gasping and panting, loud moans filling the room and spilling into the halls of the ship. Let them all know! She belonged to Mors! And yes, they were fucking! Their bodies joined, as their hips danced in the only way they could. Loud smacks of skin on skin echoed with each and every thrust. “Mark me, my beast!” she then begged, whimpering, as her face contorted with pleasure. “Fuck me deep and hard and... mark me!!” </div>

It was a sign of dominance. She knew this. But it was oh so much more. It was a sign of partnership and acceptance, of love and belonging. It was a declaration to everyone just where she stood. A choice she’d made and did not regret. 

As Mors’ teeth sank into the soft flesh of her shoulder, Iri’s groans grew louder, her hips gyrating furiously against his own. “Mmmfff...” she sighed, her hands gripping her love, while their bodies crashed together in loud, wet thwacks. She could hear that sucking slurp, as Mors cock was swallowed down by her needy little cunt, desperate to get off and feel sated. 

“Always...” Iri repeated. “Always and forever... nnnggg...” The girl cried a little from the intensity of the pleasure she felt rolling over her body. She was going to cum again, but not without her beast. She wanted to feel that hot seed pumping deep into her womb, their juices, their scent mixed into one. “Fill me, my beast... please...” She was sobbing now, her clit demanding she cum, demanding she let go. “I... I need it...” she begged. “I... I want it...” </div>

In a matter of moments, Irithriel was cumming hard along with him, tears falling down her pale, sweaty cheeks, while Mors continued to slam into her. Her little cunt was spasming frantically, strong pulses meant to milk her mate, to pull his seed in deep. “I feel it...

He was right. It was very possible that she could be carrying their young. After all, they’d been having sex a lot and without any protection whatsoever. She then crinkled her nose, smiling a bit. The idea of protection just wasn’t an option she wished to explore. If the fates decided it was their time to bring new life into the world... then so be it. There was only one she wished to have a family with and he was caressing her belly at the thought of such a future. With her. 

“Well, if it happens, my beast, we will be ready,” Iri said with confidence. “It’ll be a welcomed day when the fates decide the time is upon us and my honor to bring our young into this world.” Her blush deepened. “Though I’m feeling all right for now and I’m enjoying our honeymoon immensely.” She giggled then, leaning close to nuzzle Mors. “It’s been absolutely perfect. And I love the sculptures,” she went on. “A pretty piece of my old home. Though my home will always be with you, my beloved beast.”

At that, Irithriel leaned against Mors and sighed contentedly. She felt pleasant, though slightly sore. “So, what shall we do today, my beast?” she asked of Mors, looking up at him with wide gray eyes. </div>

And each and every smile she got to see was something she cherished. 

“Mm... a bath would be nice,” Iri agreed. She loved the feel of hot water kissing her skin and washing away the grime of the day. “We can stop by the library to get another fairytale afterwards,” she suggested. “I’ll have to think on which one to read to you,” she said with a giggle. The girl nuzzled him and then went to get dressed, choosing something akin to a nightgown fit for a princess. The shimmery material shone in the dim light, making her look like the ethereal creature she was. 

“Ready, my beast,” Iri said, spinning around twice before moving in front of him and looking up into his eyes. </div>

I noticed the tension there,” she went on. “Did something happen that I missed? Please, tell me, my beloved beast.” </div>

She was losing herself in him, her body beckoning for what it always wanted and needed. “No one...” she rasped. “No one commands my beast. My mate. My beloved... nnnggg...” His rough touches were getting her hot, aroused, her little cunt already dripping, her juices coating her thighs, her sweet scent filling the room. There was no denying what her body was wanting and it would have it. It always did. 

“Mors...” Iri sighed, her body moving against her mate, melting against him. “Mmmfff...” she groaned, her clit screaming for the goliath that was holding her. “Fuck me, mate. Let those fools know I’m yours. Let me drown in your scent and you in mine. Claim me, Mors. Mark me...” The girl kissed him back just as fiercely, her teeth grazing his jaw, his neck. “We will train when we finish our fuck,” she went on. “And they won’t doubt what happened between us, when next we see them.” </div>

Suddenly, his mouth was upon her, feasting upon her needy little cunt, as it seethed its darkest desires. “Nnngg...” she groaned, the sounds loud and working their way down the hall. Iri had to wonder if any of their new friends could hear them. No matter. They would know. Everyone would. “Mors...” she panted, body twitching slightly, as he worked up her body. Her hands reached down, grasping his hair and tugging hard. “How... how do I taste, my beast?” she asked him, another of her moans echoing throughout he room. </div>

Her man. Her Mors. But she tasted something else. There was a sweet tang lacing his lips and she knew immediately that it must be her own unique flavor. The girl blushed then, kissing her mate back deeply, as she felt his massive cock line up with her cunt. Her hips tilted then, pushing forward, eager to be one with her mate. 

“Mm...” Iri sighed, her arms moving about Mors’ neck, fingers lost in the tangles of his hair. She felt him slowly sink deeply within her folds, his cock stretching her and filling her up. She let out a low throaty groan, as he slid along her g-spot and finally struck her cervix, his tip entering her womb. “Nnnggg... Mors...” The pretty elf wrapped her legs about him then, her hips rocking, desperate for more. 

Looking up into Mors’ eyes, Iri just nodded. “You are glorious, my beloved beast. My everything.” Her blush deepened, moving along her whole body, as she arched up into his, her throbbing clit bumping gently against him, making that delicious ache only grow more. “Make love to me, my beast...” she begged. “Let us be one...” At that, she tightened her muscles wrapped around Mors’ cock for a brief moment, her juices dripping from her body due to her arousal. Only her mate could get her like this. So needy. So primed. “Mmmfff...” </div>

Mors felt so good, those wet and vulgar slurps, as her hot nerdy cunt swallowed him whole played intermittently with the slap of his balls against her backside. 

“Nnggg.... nnngg... Mors....” Iri was lost, nails digging Mors’ flesh, while her eyes rolled to the back of her head. She was in ecstasy, her body slowly climbing towards that oh so tantalizing precipice. She wanted to fall over the edge, to be consumed by pleasure only her mate could provide. 

“Harder, my beast... fuck me... fuck me... drench me in your seed...” Iri was begging, pleading, soft little sobs bubbling up, while her body succumbed to her baser instincts. This was raw and primal. This was her being fucked, taken. Claimed. She needed this. Wanted this, her little cries most likely heard in the hallway. 

Irithriel lobbed her head to the side, relishing the sensations of Mors’ mouth against her flesh. She could feel the bruises forming, a sweet reminder of this moment. The heat. The passion. “Mmmfff... make me cum!” she then cried, feeling his hands—hard—upon her hips. </div>

He growled and kept kissing her neck until he found his mark and when he heard her final plea he did what she demanded of him, hi bit her, her sweet blood once again on his tongue, then he let himself go deep inside her, filling her once again with all his seed, he could feel her milk him like always, taking all her little body could hold of him, he gave her a couple of more thrust and finally he stopped enjoying his high and the perfect feeling of his mate. </div>

Her groans were louder than the creaks and moans of their bed, as it shook beneath them, just barely holding their weight. “I feel it... oh god... my Mors!!!”

Irithriel lost it. Her body giving into pleasure, as she writhed and convulsed beneath Mors’ welcome weight. Her clit throbbed hard, while her cunt milked every last drop from his massive cock, while he rode out his orgasm. Her muscles were pulsing, holding him tightly, while pulling all of his seed deep into her womb. She was his, and in every way. Not a soul could doubt their union. Not a soul could tear them apart. 

“I love you for always, my beast. Until my dying day and after...” Irithriel cried, hot tears streaming down her cheeks. She was so full of love that her trembling body could hardly bear it. She hugged him tightly then, her body riding out its own orgasm, while she pressed herself close and buried her face against him. </div>

Irithriel kissed him back just as ferociously, letting herself get lost in him. His scent was all over her, her body freshly fucked, her womb dripping with his seed. She snuggled close to him, light bruises and that bite marring her otherwise flawless flesh. Looking up at him, she just smiled and nodded. 

“I’m all right, my beloved beast. I’ll always be all right so long as we’re together.” Iri nuzzled Mors’ chest and planted a few gentle kisses upon him. “So we will definitely fight and train. I... I need it. I... I know it.” The pretty elf saw no reason to hide her flaws and shortcomings. Especially not with her Mors. If he could help her, if this allowed her to be at his side... she’d do this willingly and ask for the help. “You’ll help me, right? I want to be at my best. For you. For... for us.” She blushed then, her face going rather red. Soft giggles left her and she hugged him once more before reluctantly moving so that they both could get dressed. 

At least they both had been sated. For now. </div>

Looking back up at him, she then moved to get dressed, picking yet another dress, though one more practical for training. She put on some armor and picked up her weapons. “I’m ready, my beast.

Well, that was if he let her have his way. And, he typically did. The girl found it sweet that he’d dote on her in his way, one she cherished with all her heart. The pretty elf skipped into their room, humming, while clutching the book tightly to her chest. She was still wearing her nightdress, hair damp from their earlier bath together. 

“So, my beast,” Iri said, moving near their bed. She set the book down and turned to look at her Mors. “Are you ready for today’s tale?” She looked at him with wide, hopeful eyes, her skin still pink from her earlier embarrassment when she’d nearly cum in front of others. The girl stepped towards him, her gown clinging to her body, her scent starting to permeate the air of the room. 

“I think you’ll enjoy this one. I long for your take. I do so love our talks,” Iri said before giggling softly. She truly did. It was wonderful to have such lengthy discussions over something she adored. It only proved further just how right her Mors was for her. The perfect mate. At that, she moved back towards their bed and started reaching for the book she’d borrowed from the library. </div>

She sighed contentedly, her snowy head nestled against his shoulder. “Mmm...” The pretty elf turned her head slightly and kissed his chest, before giving him an affectionate nuzzle. 

“So, the story for tonight,” Iri began, her voice pleasant like a melody. “Once upon a time in the middle of a thick forest stood a small cottage, the home of a pretty little girl known to everyone as Little Red Riding Hood.” She looked up at her beast and smiled. She knew this one, like all the others, would spark the most delightful of conversations. 

“‘And what big hands you have!’ exclaimed Little Red Riding Hood, stepping over to the bed,” Iri continued reading, her gray eyes seeking out her Mors, wanting to gauge his reactions. “‘The better to hug you with,’ said the wolf.” She bit down on her lip and shifted. “‘What a big mouth you have,’ the little girl murmured in a weak voice.” The girl squeaked, her body tense as the story got darker and darker. “‘The better to eat you with!’ growled the wolf, and jumping out of bed, he swallowed her up too.”

Iri continued the story, her tiny hands clutching the book, while her body moved closer to Mors. “As they walked quickly through the trees, the little girl told her mother: ‘We must always keep to the path and never stop. That way, we come to no harm!’” At that, she closed the book and placed it on her lap. “Well, what are your thoughts on this one, my beast?” <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="15-Nov-19 07:36 PM">(edited)</span></div>

Suddenly, he helped her remove her nightdress, the filmy garment falling into a tiny heap on the floor beside their bed. He leaned in close then and she could feel his hot breath tickling her neck, as he nuzzled her affectionately. 

“Mm...” Iri sighed, nuzzling her mate in return. The pretty elf just smiled and placed the book on the little table next to them. “Werewolves?” she said. “Have you ever met one?” Her hands moved to Mors’ arms, her delicate fingers dancing along his skin. “Have you ever seen a Blood Hunter?” She’d never met either and wanted to know more. </div>

As always, he was tender and gentle despite his massive size and gruff demeanor. Of course, his beast unleashed most of the time when they made love, but it was a testament to the love and devotion pent up inside. The girl looked into his eyes, her own far off and thoughtful. 

“You really knew one, my beast?” Iri’s face lit up. “Sounds terrifying and exciting. Did he ever find a way to lift the curse?” she then asked, concerned for his friend, someone she’d never met. “Though I’ll remember the magic,” she said. “I promise. I wonder if we ever come across another if we might help them cure their affliction?” Per typical, the pretty elf just longed for others to smile and have a reason to dream. While she asked Mors her questions, her hands continued to lovingly caress his body, her fingers finding their way to his hair. She let her nails graze his scalp, fingers gently tugging his locks. “A cursed life of lycanthropy just sounds too sad and tragic to ignore.” </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Irithriel blushed deeply, her pretty lips curved into a smile. It meant so much to her that she and Mors has found each other and professed their devotion and love. She truly thought she’d be destined for a loveless match, one filled with fear and despair. Though she’d been terrified to have been abandon back in the woods of the Feywild, it had honestly been the best thing to have ever happened. It proved to be a turning point in her life, allowing her to reassess who she was and her purpose. It also carved the path that led her to her mate, her love, her other half. 

Mors turned her Iri’s head, his lips crashing upon hers. The girl would never tire of his touch or attention, the goliath had so much affection to give and she’d be there to receive it and give him her own in return. “Mm...” she sighed, lips parting, tongues dancing. It was enough to make her tummy flutter, her heart speed up. He’d always have that affect on her. Forever and always. 

“What makes me happiest, my beast, is being by your side. Always. I love you.” Iri’s blush only darkened, her hands gently caressing Mors’ face. “Oh... oh my...” she went on, listening to the last of his story from his past. “At least his intentions had been good. Pity a night of drunkenness almost ruined that goal. Did he continue his pursuit, my beast?” she asked, moving close to nuzzle and kiss his neck. </div>

He was just waiting for the call and it was one they both knew she’d make. The girl continued to tease her mate’s neck, her lips soft and light, as she trailed kisses along his skin. She enjoyed taunting the beast, seeing how long he’d stay at bay before unleashing and staking it’s claim. It usually wasn’t long and she liked that very much. 

Iri gasped softly, as Mors’ hands began to touch and explore what was his. Her little body molding against him, while he pulled her close, his hard cock fitting snuggly against her hot and wet sex. Her scent was strong, permeating the room and her senses. She was dripping with desire, his lips so welcome when he claimed her own. She shifted slightly, her damp folds rubbing against him, a tease yet a promise, her body was welcoming him home. </div>

His hands were then everywhere, their mouths stuck fast in a heated kiss. She was breathless, skin rosy and warm. All the girl could do was nod in compliance, when her beast made his very bold claim. 

“Yes, my beast,” Iri whispered, her hips already moving with Mors’. “As you please,” she went on. “And just for your eyes... just yours.” The pretty elf sighed then, the sounds of their love making already filling the room. She arched slightly, a throaty groan released from her lips. As her head lolled back and to the side, her thick white curls also fell, revealing that mark that never fully healed. That mark that showed everyone to whom she belonged. 

“You feel so good, my beast...” Iri whispered, her voice wavering, as pleasure began to take hold. “So deep... nnnggg... I feel you stretching me... mmm...” The girl was panting her pleasure, gripping Mors’ arms, while she bounced lightly upon him. </div>

The wet sounds of their coupling filled the room, her scent absolutely everywhere. “Nnnggg...” she moaned loudly, gripping his arms tightly, while Mors held fast to her waist. His hands easily encircled her torso, the slightest effort making their hips crash harder, faster, more. 

Just then, Mors leaned in. He had one hand taunting and teasing a breast, while his mouth assaulted the other. The girl hissed in response, back arching hard, so that he could better access those soft mounds. She was presenting them to him, as he took. Every part of her wanting to give him just that much more. 

Mors’ cock filled Iri’s cunt, the tight entrance pulsing its need. Her muscles were squeezing him, begging for him to claim her, take her. To remind her that her body was his. Her little noises filled the room, her needy body demanding his full attention. It knew what it wanted, what it needed. It knew that it longed to be one.

Biting down on her lip, Irithriel’s hips desperately seeking his, the elf could feel him slowly thrusting in and out and in again. The way he slid within her hot wet folds was driving her mad, her body screaming, as her cunt tried to swallow him whole. He moved against her clit, that little fleshy nub throbbing with fiery fury, the need for his beast.

“Nnggg... Mors...” Iri rasped. “Please...” The girl was begging, pleading, her senses lost within her mate. “I need the beast... I want it.” Warm tears welled in her gray eyes, spilling down along her pale cheeks. “Nnnggg... please...” she whined, her hands grasping at him, frantic and in need. Her little body needed to feel him plunging deep inside her body, filling her womb with his hot sticky seed. “I want it all...” </div>

She was going mad, being driven to the brink before they’d even done anything yet. The girl whispered beneath him, his weight warm and welcome. “Please...” she whined softly, Mors finally letting her go, only to part her legs all the wider to receive him. 

“Nngg...” Iri groaned, her body arching up to meet his. “Mors... please...” She was begging, hips bucking, as he thrust so deeply inside her. Her body began to bounce against him, soft grunts passing over her lips, as a sheen of sweat formed over her soft skin. “I need you, my beast...” she cried, hands now free and desperately grasping for him. Her head lolled to the side, Mors’ mark once more visible for him to see. 

“I feel you. I feel all of it...” Iri panted, almost breathless. “Please, my beast... fill me up...” The elf bucked her hips wildly, those wet sounds of their bodies crashing together echoing off the walls and down the halls. “Don’t stop...” she pleaded... “Oh... nnggg... right there... right there...” The bed shook beneath them, the headboard thumping against the wall. Whoever resided next door would certainly get an earful. </div>

“I’m going to cum, my beast...” Iri rasped, the girl whimpering loudly in his arms. Her legs wrapped tightly about Mors’ waist, her hips moving at a fevered pitch. It wasn’t long before she felt him erupt deep in her womb, his hot seed once more coating her womb. “Yes... yes...!” she cried, her clit throbbing, as her body succumbed to the ecstasy on he could provide. She was falling into the abyss of pleasure, joining her mate as he roared out his climax. “All yours, my beast! Marked and claimed.... do you feel it?” Her little cunt spasmed hard about his cock, squeezing and milking him for every drop he could offer. 

“Nngg... god...” Iri exclaimed, her body slowing, as she relished the feel of Mors’ cock still buried within her depths, their bodies one. She was basking in the aftermath of their love making, her body feeling pleasant and sated. Sore. “Mm...” she sighed, nuzzling her mate lovingly, so happy to be in his arms. </div>

He was fierce, a man to fear and cower before. But... to Irithriel... he was tender and sweet, a man who saw her as something special to love and cherish. And oh how she loved him right back. The elf looked up at him, breathless with rosy cheeks. She could see that sparkle in his eye and it wasn’t that strange unnatural glow they sometimes took on when he became protective, ready to conquer and defend. No, it was something else. Something more. And it made the girl feel warm inside. 

When Mors laughed lightly, Iri couldn’t help but smile. She loved the way it sounded, how it reached his eyes whenever she was near. It made her happy knowing she pleased him, that somehow she managed to bring him joy. Her delicate hands gently touched his back, her legs still wrapped about his waist. She could feel him still inside her, their bodies one as they were meant to be. 

“We do...” Iri agreed, almost shyly. “I do love our reading sessions and chats.” She giggled softly, sweetly, her hips tilting to meet Mors’, as he thrust against her once more. His actions earned him a soft groan, as her body moved to seek his out, wanting to be close. “Nngg...” The mix of their juices were running along her thighs and making a mess of the bed, though she hardly cared. She let her hands move up his back and finally lose themselves in his hair. “Mm...” she then sighed, kissing him right back, her tummy all a flutter. “I love you, my beast.” </div>

He moved his hands to her beautiful ass and gave her a small spank, &quot;We need to find you more concealing dresses for you to be around the ship....

She looked up at him, blushing even more at his admission, a shiver running down along her spine, as his breath tickled her ear. Though she had to agree. Just then, she tightened her muscles, the walls of her cunt clamping down upon his cock, while it still remained deep inside her depths. 

“Oh!” Iri then yelped, when Mors suddenly spanked her. She looked up at him and pouted sweetly. “What... what’s wrong with my nightdresses?” she then asked demurely, her gray eyes going wide and curious. “They cover me completely, my beast. Do you... do you not like them? Do they not please you?” The girl blushed harder, blinking rapidly, as she listened. “Wait... really?” she then squeaked. “You wanted to tear at my nightdress?” At that, she giggled and buried her face against his chest, planting tiny kisses along his skin. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="23-Nov-19 04:42 AM">(edited)</span></div>

Without thought or care, she kissed him back just as ferociously. Passionately. Her little sighs could be heard, while their mouths moved against the other’s. “They torture you?” she asked when he pulled away. “This sort of nightdress was common in the Feywild. I... I... it’s just what all the elven nobility would wear when not at the courts,” she explained, her face going pink. “Would you rather I wear something else then, my beast? We could go shopping if that is your desire.” The girl paused, his hands suddenly on her hips. 

Gasping softly, Iri just looked into Mors’ eyes. “Nnggg...” she groaned softly, when he thrust his hips against hers once more. Her body arched, her breaths heavier. “Wait... can everyone see...?” she then asked, body still writhing beneath him. His mouth then moved to her breasts, making her gasp all the more. “Oh god...” she rasped, her hands tugging on his hair, encouraging him further. At that, her own hips began to move with his, her body responding easily. “You like them...” she whimpered. “Yet you don’t... mmm...” The girl moaned and moved against her mate. “My beast is truly complicated...” she complained, though she loved him for it, her desire and love for him clear. 

Whimpering louder, Iri let her hands explore her Mors’ body. They moved through his hair and down along his back, finger tips tracing every line, every scar. “Mm... my beast...” she panted, hips moving even faster. </div>

He loved how his pretty elf always went wild when he was insiy of her, he used his hands to add more force to her movements, guiding her and helping her bounce harder and harder on him, the feeling of her hot and wet insides coiling around his shaft was like a drug to him, &quot;Yes mate...

                    <div class="markdown">“Always yours, my beast... nnggg... always yours...” Irithriel’s hips were moving faster and faster, her little body bouncing hard against him. She looked up at Mors, her expression contorted with pleasure, her breaths heavy and loud. “So deep, my beast... nnggg...” 

Irithriel could hear their bodies slapping together with every thrust that Mors made. His balls slapping at her backside and her hips bucking wildly, while her breasts jiggled against his chest. “Nngg... Mors...” she whimpered, lost within the feelings, the emotion. She loved when he got possessive, boldly stating just how much she pleased him, he wanted her. Every single time, it served to overwhelm her senses. 

“My beast... you’re stretching me... I... I love it...” Iri cried, her moans resonating within their room. Her legs squeezed around Mors’ waist, urging him on, to lay claim. He was hitting her cervix, every movement teasing that sensitive spot so deep inside. She was losing it, delirious with pleasure, as she cried out his name over and over. “Mors... Mors...” Her clit was swollen and throbbing, her juices making a mess. But she hardly cared. They were one. “So close, my beast...” she sobbed. </div>

He used his other hand to fist her hair and make her look at him in the eye, &quot;Come for me... Give me everything...&quot; He commanded her roughly, his eyes glowing and voice echoing around them, she could feel his power being released again, but never harming her, only adding another layer of sensation to their love making. </div>

Her body was a steel trap controlled by none other than her Mors. His grip was firm. Rough. And his voice bled with an aura she couldn’t hope to refuse if she’d tried. “Nnnggg...” she panted hard, grunting when Mors grabbed her hair, her eyes locked with his. The girl could feel his fingers teasing that little bundle of nerves, the fleshy nub quivering against his touch. It was ripe and ready, swollen and wet. His voice was the only thing keep her grounded, the only thing her body demanded she follow. Without further hesitation, she succumbed to his power, crying out as her climax consumed her whole. 

“Oh god...” Iri rasped, her juices gushing hard, while her cunt undulated its sweet pulsing rhythm about Mors’ cock. It wanted it deep, finding her womb. It wanted it where it knew belonged. “Claim me, my beast...” she then begged, sobbing beneath him, her eyes still fixed to his. “Nnnggg... god... please...” </div>

He kissed her again then, swallowing her cries, taking everything from him, they had made a big mess again but he didn&#39;t care anymore, he released her hair and embraced her, pulling her against him, still kissing her, devouring her, this was all he needed.

After they calmed down a little, he let his body fall on the bed again, his little elf still in his arms, resting on top of him, he just moved his hands around her back, letting her calm down and relax, he growled a little, he could steel feel the bruises where the dragon had crushed his armor and practically impaled him with his fangs, &quot;That dragon did a number on me, but it doesn&#39;t compare to you little moon, you just completely destroyed me...&quot; He said to her between chuckles, he was really tired now, thanks to his insatiable little elf. </div>

Her tiny body bouncing roughly against him, while his cock continued thrusting in and out, in and out. “Nnnggg... I’m cumming! I’m cumming!” she cried, skin flushed and body twitching. Her little cunt was convulsing hard, drawing him deeper still, as he suddenly pumped her full to overflowing with his hot, sticky seed. It was what she wanted, needed, her body taking it all. 

Suddenly, their mouths found each other. Lips moving wildly, while their hips gyrated together through those final intense pulses of orgasm. Her body was his... always. Nothing could keep her away. Nothing would ever part them. Iri suddenly choked on a sob, her emotions momentarily getting the best of her. 

As Mors’ hold on her lessened, Iri buried her face against his chest. She soaked up the tender feeling of him gently caressing and appreciating her. Loving her. Never would she doubt him. Their hearts and souls were one. The girl propped herself up a bit, her eyes easily finding his. She could see the happiness in her mate’s face, the love and adoration. It was truly humbling. Never had she thought it possible another could ever feel this way for her. 

“We both need our rest, my beast,” Iri said softly, her cheeks damp with her tears from her earlier pleasure and her current joy. “I want you in tip top shape.” She gave Mors a smile and moved in closer still, her head resting upon his chest, while her fingers danced lightly over his skin. Her body felt nice. Sated and sore. He was perfect, her true love. And she’d do everything to make sure he remained happy, that she could see that smile and hear that laugh... the ones only meant for her. </div>

She was aching for her mate, her heart pleading he somehow find her and return. But she knew it wouldn’t be so simple. Not after those final words back in Primal Point. 

As Iri looked at the bed, her chest suddenly tightened. “Mors...” she whispered, fresh tears falling down her face. Despite the redness of her eyes and blotchiness of her face, she was still a sight to behold. And she knew her Mors would find her perfect... flaws and all. “Mors...” she muttered again. She moved closer to the bed, able to imagine her beast upon it. She could feel his arms about her, holding her close. She could feel his warmth, their hearts beating as one, their bodies joined. “Mors...”

Iri sat down on the bed and moved to curl up upon it. She could smell him, feel him. Her tiny body shook with sobs when suddenly she realized her fists weren’t empty. In her left hand, something cool and smooth brushed against her palm. Opening her hand there was a strange jewel—a black opal. She sniffled softly and studied the gem. It was a sign, she decided. Something of value she could trade for aid. She’d find her Mors... even if it meant dying to do so. </div>

Slowly, she moved towards the door, resting her hand against it. “H-hello?” she said through the closed door, suddenly unsure if it was wise to just open it and see who was on the other side. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Irithriel just nodded, tears glistening, while they spilled along her cheeks. She saw one of the darlings gesture to the shield strapped to the pack. “Oh... no...” she whimpered. Seeing Mors’ shield was enough to make her cry all over again. Sniffling, she hugged the two little minions even more. “We will find him,” she whispered to them both. “We must. Right?” The pretty elf pulled back and showed both the opal. “I don’t know how, but upon return from Primal Point, I was somehow given this.” The girl let the two darlings peer at the gem she held in her hand. “We can use this to hire aid. We will get him back. We have to.”

At that, Iri gave each minion a soft kiss on the cheek. She then went over to the table and pulled out some parchment and ink. Soon, she was furiously scribbling upon the pages, writing an ad for help. An ad for those whom might help her find Mors. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">A few days had past since Irithriel and Mors returned to the ship, though the jungle was hardly forgotten. The pretty elf knew that what her beloved beast had started to build was theirs and one day would have to return to their care. Though she was glad someone trusted was overseeing things in the meantime. 

Iri had taken some time to rest and recuperate, her tiny body utterly exhausted and now most likely a vessel carrying new life. The girl’s cheeks flushed a dark shade of pink, while she sat in the window, looking outside to the vast countryside below. Her thoughts were slightly preoccupied. She’d noticed Mors’ restlessness... was it worry, or perhaps frustration? Whatever it was, it concerned her, her heart aching for her mate to be well. 

As Iri peered through the window, her lacy dress hung perfectly on her body. Oblivious to how she might come off to others in her current attire, and merely mimicking what she’d known as a noble of house Phiarlan, it was easy for any onlooker to see through the material and glimpse her curves. That delicate shape of her elven body, while she sat there absently humming to herself, one hand gently rubbing her belly. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="10-Feb-20 09:23 PM">(edited)</span></div>

He was only wearing his helmet, the rest of his metal armor and shield were in the place where he ussually left them, another thing he couldn&#39;t remember fully but the spot just felt right to drop his things. He walked to the corner where his shield was and put the hammer down besides it.

He took a deep breath, trying to calm down after having to deal with that fool from the library and then turned to look towards the window where his mate was sitting.

He stood there for a minute, just taking her in and feeling his heart to change it&#39;s pace. He was still angry, that was a constant feeling inside him but just looking at her made everything feel different, specially seeing her rubbing her belly.

&quot;I remembered this book.&quot; Despite the gentle way he talked, his voice still echoed around the room, &quot;it&#39;s not the same if I read it.&quot; He confessed to her as he came closer to her and softly lowered the book into her lap, leaving his hands free to wrap them around her. &quot;How are you feeling?&quot; He asked her and kissed the top her head, taking her sweet scent and turned his eyes to where she was looking, trying to see what was so interesting. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Irithriel kept up her humming and could hear the little blues happily sighing in a far corner across the room. She smiled inwardly, hand still caressing her belly. Palm moving over soft lace. Her gray eyes were fixed on the snowy hills dotted with houses, comforting smoke billowing from their chimneys. Just then, she perked up, her pretty tune stopping, as she turned to see Mors enter and set down his things. 

“I’m well, my beast,” Iri reassured, nuzzling her goliath, as he wrapped his arms about her and rewarded her with the gentlest of kisses. The girl smiled up at him, the weight of a book suddenly resting against her lap. “Oh this!” she exclaimed brightly, eyes glittering with a warmth only for her mate. “This was the first of so many fairytales I read to you. I...” Her cheeks reddened and she made a soft little noise, as her smile broadened. 

“I often read to you, my beast...” Iri’s face darkened even more. “It’s why I call you that. <em>My beast</em>,” she explained. “After I read it to you, we discussed it. And then... then you dared me to challenge the one I wanted. To conquer him...” She averted her gaze then, her lips still curved into a smile. “So, I challenged you, my beast. And I’ve had your affection ever since, just as you have mine.” She looked back up at him then. “I can read it to you again, if you’d like,” she offered, moving closer to feel Mors’ warmth. How she’d missed him. </div>

He could remember some of what she said but it was fragmented. &quot;It&#39;s strange... This place.&quot; He said after taking his eyes away from the window and looked down into her eyes, &quot;There&#39;s almost no danger lurking in every corner, free food and comfort...&quot; <em>How did I end up here in the first place?</em> He wondered for a second but didn&#39;t dwell on it because despite everything it was the perfect place to have his pregnant mate for now. He moved one big hand to her belly.

 &quot;I met some fools that could be trouble in the library but they are nothing.&quot; He growled, a little annoyed at the encounter he had and then remembered something important, &quot;Is there a healer in this place? Do we even need one?&quot; He asked with a little distrust while softly rubbing his hand over her belly. He didn&#39;t trust this place completely just yet, but he had chosen this ship for a reason before and do far it was adequate... at least while his minions finishing building his fortress, the green ones were smart but they lacked physical strength to build things not made of wood. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Irithriel set the book aside for later. She knew she’d read it to Mors later that evening. Just a little something to give him comfort and place his mind at ease and also to hopefully help jog his memory a bit. The pretty elf let her arms work their way about Mors. Despite their size differences, they still fit together quite perfectly. Yes... as he’d often told her—designed for each other. And she’d believe nothing else. Not ever. 

“Yes,” Iri said softly. “Quite different from the jungle or your island. You told me a few stories of your time then. Though most of even that had been a blur for you.” She gave him a loving squeeze, nestling close against him. “My own homeland was also fraught with dangers. It was one of many reasons why it had been so cruel of my brother, Vae, to abandon me. I’m originally a noble from the Feywild,” she explained further. “A descendant of house Phiarlan. There was war brewing when last I’d been.”

With a soft sigh, Iri pulled back and looked up at Mors. Her features soft and delicate. Small. His own were roughened from battles and horrors she knew she couldn’t imagine. Still... he was hers and she was his. She smiled then, reaching upward and touching his chest. “What sorts did you meet in the library? Perhaps we can have the minions keep an eye on them,” she then suggested. Giggling softly, happily, she brought her hand down over his, when he rubbed at her belly. “I do believe there’s one,” she answered, regarding Mors’ question about a healer. “I probably should see one about...” The elf looked down at her belly and then up at her mate, cheeks flushed though eyes were bright. “I’m unsure how far along I am.” </div>

He took off his helmet with his free hand and put it on top of the book, leaving his face free so he could kiss her without the danger of hurting her with the cold metal.

&quot;Feywild... I remember some, a frozen place filled with bullshit magic.... And then... I met you, on the top deck.&quot; He remembered stepping out of that frozen hell and looking for a place to rest and that was when she appeared. He smiled a little and leaned down to kiss her, he tried to make it soft but after feeling her perfect lips on his he couldn&#39;t resist and deepened it, taking her mouth like the conqueror he was, one of his hands still rubbing her belly and the other was on the back of her head to keep her in place.

<em>Yes, this feels right.</em> He thought while he took his feel of his mate, he had been too preoccupied to explore the ship, making sure it was a safe place while she rested after the jungle, to properly enjoy having her like this. 

&quot;You also told me about the fools of your family.&quot; He said softly after breaking the kiss and pushing their foreheads together, just enjoying the feeling of having her in his arms. &quot;And what happened after you brought me to this room for the first time.&quot; He finished after a small chuckle, yes, he could remember that most of the time they ended up fucking in this room. &quot;We should find that healer before we end up like that again little moon.&quot; He growled after feeling his body getting ready to become one with his mate again but he wanted to make sure that everything was alright first.

He lowered his face to her neck and gave her a small kiss on the spot he could remember always marking her, <em>Later..</em> He promised himself and leaned back, opening how glowing eyes and looking at her, &quot;And don&#39;t worry about that fool from the library, the green ones are already patrolling the place to keep an eye on things.&quot; </div>

My brother is a fool and a bully. All of them are. I have no want to return to my homeland now,” she went on. “Not even with our most wonderful news.” The pretty elf sighed then, just relishing the way it felt to be touched and held and cherished by her mate. 

“All that matters now is our future. Our family. I love you, my beast,” Iri then whispered, her smile never faltering. She felt her heart race, while her tummy fluttered. Never had she loved anyone so completely and without condition. It felt freeing. 

“Well then, let’s go find this elusive healer then,” Iri continued. “I’m sure we’ll find them easily enough.” The girl slid out of the window, her arms still touching her Mors. Suddenly, her expression turned thoughtful and she gasped. “Do you suppose this healer could tell us if we are having a boy or a girl? Will they be more like me or you?” Her smile broadened and she bounced giddily in the goliath’s arms. “Our child will be wonderful no matter what, but...” She giggled softly then. “I’m curious to know so we can prepare.”

Iri nodded and led Mors towards the doorway. She then turned towards the little blues. “You stay here for now, little darlings. Your green playmates are out scouting and watching. Only open the door for your playmates or us. No one else is to enter our room.” She blew the two minions some kisses and moved out of their room, heading for the <span class="mention">#med-bay</span>. </div>

&quot;Yes, come here.&quot; He said after sitting on the bed, getting comfortable and gesturing her to join him. He had tried to read the book by himself, trying to see if it brought back more memories but nothing happened. <em>Maybe this time I will remember more.</em> He thought and just waited for Iri to start reading the story. </div>

She nestled close, her body molding against his like she was meant to be there. With a sweet little smile, she set the book out before them both and opened it, her delicate fingers lovingly smoothing out the yellowed pages. The girl sighed then and began to read. Her voice was low and soft, a soothing sound to ease the senses. Everything about her was sweetness and light, laughter and song. She was a radiant delight, while one hand moved to gently stroke along Mors’ arm in an absent manner. The girl was happy. Content. Savoring this moment the two of them were sharing. 

When Iri finally finished the tale of Beauty and the Beast, she close the book with a gentle thud. Her body twisted slightly, so she could look up into Mors’ eyes. She wanted to see his face, feel his heart. The pretty elf reached up and let her hands caress his face, reading each line, each angle. “Did that feel right, my beast?” she then asked him, breaking the brief silence with her melodic voice. </div>

When she finished reading and started to caress him with her soft touch he growled a little and wrapped his arms around her, pulling her on top of his broad naked chest. &quot;He only lost his power in the end, what a fool. But I already told you that...&quot; He said and opened his eyes, they were glowing like usual and his evil aura filled the space around them. &quot;I remember now. Every moment since you found me on top of the ship.&quot; He could also remember the fool that took him down the second time, he was a giant with glowing eyes like him, but he saved that thought for another time and focused on his beautiful mate.

&quot;I told you didn&#39;t I? Nothing will be able to separate us, we are one and the same.&quot; He said with a growl and used one his his hands to pull her into a deep kiss, telling her with actions everything he was feeling in that moment, while his other hand started to caress her beautiful body. </div>

It felt nice to be so close to him, his arms wrapped about her, while their bodies settled against the other. He felt good. Too good. Oh, she’d missed this. The closeness and intimacy. Her skin reddened, as her face grew hot. 

“Yes, you did, my beast,” Iri whispered, unable to stop the tiny whimpers from escaping her lips. “I prefer the beast, which is why I wanted you. Needed you. Everything inside me screamed at me that we were one and... we are.” The girl lowered her gaze, pulling herself into a straddle, while Mors’ hands pet and explored. She sighed loudly, content etched on her face, as her eyes rolled back. “Mmm...” 

Iri arched her back, chest jutting forward, while her hips rocked ever so slightly against him. “Nnnggg god...” she rasped, her body responding to her mate. Crying for him. Begging. “I’ve missed you, my beast. So very much.” The pretty elf leaned forward then, Mors pulling her close for a heated kiss. She felt her entire body ignite in that moment. Readying itself for what it wanted and needed. “Mors...” she whined softly, her legs parting for him, as her juices began dripping down along her thighs, an invitation. Her desire. Her need to be one with her mate. </div>

He moved so he was sitting on the edge of the bed with his pretty elf straddling him and released her mouth to start kissing her neck. 

&quot;Yes little moon... We had been apart too long.&quot; He grolwed against her neck, his voice echoing around them. Meanwhile his hands slowly went under her dress, first caressing her legs and little by little going upwards on her body, touching her soft skin and taking her dress off as he went.

He was rock hard under his pants and could feel her juices dripping from her but he wanted to take things slow while he still had some control of himself. </div>

The girl whimpered softly, relishing the closeness and attention and soon found herself bared before the goliath. She brought her hands up and placed them against his chest, his crotch now hard between her legs. Slowly, she began caressing him, drinking in the moment they were sharing right there. Right then. 

“Far too long...” Iri whispered, her hips suddenly rocking against Mors’ hardened groin. She groaned then, her hands sliding down along his skin until her fingers brushed against the hem of his pants. Immediately, they began working to unfasten everything, a little something to help him remove that terrible barrier keeping them apart. 

“I... I need you, my beast,” Iri went on, her body trembling in anticipation, while her hips continued to slowly move, her body all but writhing against him. When she’d undid Mors’ pants, she let her hands slip beneath the fabric, freeing him from the restrictive confines. Oh, he was velvet smooth against her heated cunt, the little hole seething with desire to be filled. “Please,” she whined, more juices dripping from her, coating his cock, as she rubbed against him. </div>

When they managed to take his pants away he growled really loud and the air around then was filled with his evil power. The feeling Iri&#39;s heated sex rubbing against his hard one and the lovely sounds she was making made him become a beast with only one thing in his mind.

His hands landed on her hips, their grip strong but not enough to cause her pain. He turned them around on the bed, his big body covering her and his hands pushed her legs wide open, leaving her ready to take him. He moved his hips, aligning her big cock with her dripping hole and with another growl, &quot;Mine...&quot; He pushed inside until he couldn&#39;t go deeper anymore, finally joining his mate like one after too long being apart. The feeling was so intense that he had to close his eyes and stop moving for a few seconds, if he were a little less of a beast he would have stopped and made sure she had gotten used to him being inside her again but he wasn&#39;t and he knew his mate was made for him so he opened his glowing eyes again, looking directly into her eyes and started to move his hips, giving her exactly what he knew she wanted in that moment. </div>

The girl groaned, her head lolling back and exposing the supple flesh of her neck. She was in the throes of ecstasy, her body easily remembering what it had been designed to fit—her mate, her beast. 

“Nnnggg...” Iri moaned, a throaty sound full of longing and desire, her little cunt gripping Mors’ cock like a vice, the further he went. The moment she felt his hips move, her own began to rock, desperate to meet his and match the pace he was setting. “Mors...” she whispered, breathless, tears rolling down her cheeks. She was in utter bliss, overwhelmed by this sweet union she’d been denied for far too long. Her body needed this and she recalled Mr Bofwant’s words—this would not harm the baby. Their child was strong. She’d no doubts about it. And knowing she bore this life only made her long for her mate all the more. 

“Feels so good, my beast... so good... nnggg...” Iri cried, the sounds of their hips crashing against the other growing more and more vulgar, wet slurps, as her dripping cunt swallowed down Mors’ cock. “I’m all yours...” she went on, his declaration that she was his making her shiver with absolute delight. “Always yours. Just yours...” </div>

Mors wanted more, wanted everything she was offering him so he leaned forward and started to lick and kiss her lovely neck.

His hands released her legs, one of them was just holding his weight while the other started to roam her body again. He had no words in that moment, almost a mindless beast just loving his mate and enjoying how her body reacted to his touch. His mouth kept going lower and lower until he found that spot on her shoulder where he liked to leave his mark, his kisses growing more rough until he was practically nibbling her skin, marking his territory like the beast he was.

He could feel her walls gripping him, fighting against him every time he moved inside her and he wanted more, in the back of his mind he knew he wouldn&#39;t harm her or their child so he just let his instincts go free and started to thrust harder and faster, their hips crashing against each other every time he pushed inside her dripping pussy. </div>

Her hands wrapped about him, pulling him closer, while her hips frantically bucked beneath his welcomed weight. His balls were slapping her thighs, his cock filling her full. It was sheer ecstasy. 

“Nnnggg.... Mors...” Iri moaned, the bed now scraping at the floor, while the headboard began to rhythmically bump against the wall. They were unashamedly loud and the girl found herself not minding in the slightest. Her little CUNY’s grip held fast, as he slid in and out, pumping hard against her much smaller body. “Don’t stop.... oh god....” she begged, that slow burn growing brighter. 

Iri was utterly intoxicated by her mate, drowning in him, as he took all that she gave and more. They were one. Together. And soon... a family. “Feels good.... so good...” Her body writhed beneath him, hot and needy, ripe with delicious desire. Those wet sounds only excited her more, her body giving into the pleasure they were sharing in that moment. “Take me, my beast... claim what’s yours...” Her little cries were a mix of begging and demanding. She needed her mate. Wanted him. And she wanted to remember this union later when their minds and bodies quieted. 

“Nnnggg... Mors.... Mors....” His name was the only coherent word in Iri’s mind. So she cried it out, letting it ground her, while her body took the onslaught of sensation and pleasure she could only find with her mate. </div>

His mouth left her neck and kept going lower and lower until he found her bouncing breasts and took one while grabbing the other with his big hand, claiming everything like she told him to.

He didn&#39;t know how long they had been mating like this, so desperate to reconnect with eachother, it could have been minutes or hours but he was too lost to care. Little by little he could feel his cock getting bigger, harder, ready to explode inside her, to fill her with his seed after so long. He raised his head to look into her eyes, burning the image of his mate&#39;s pleasure in his mind as he kept fucking her like a beast, his own sounds of pleasure growing louder and louder as the pleasure became more intense. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Irithriel gasped loudly when Mors suddenly took one of her heaving breasts into his mouth. The soft, supple flesh had always been sensitive, but now... now it was a whole other level. The moment she felt her mate’s tongue swirl about her hardened nipple, she almost came undone. The lightest of touches and she found herself even closer to the edge than she’d been. 

“Oh god...” Iri rasped, her hand moving to Mors’ head, encouraging the goliath to take his fill. It was obvious her breasts were even more sensitive than before, every bit of attention they received causing her to reel in the most blissful of pleasure. At that, her legs spread further, hips gyrating with a fevered frenzy, as that burn of ecstasy grew larger and brighter. It wouldn’t be long now, her body having no choice but to give in and quiver in oh so sweet agony. 

While Iri’s body was buckling, teetering on the edge, she felt Mors’ grow even harder. His already fast pace was quickening. Like her, she knew he felt it. That urge for their bodies to plummet together. She looked up into his eyes then. They were glowing. And his own grunts and growls were filling the air. It was enough to send her over the edge, spiraling into the throes of passion, while her dripping cunt suddenly squeezed his cock, gripping it tightly and pulling him deeper still. 

Just then, Iri’s body began shaking beneath Mors’ weight, convulsing with pleasure, as she cried out without care. “Mors... Mors... I’m cumming, my beast... all for you...” Those little muscles within her cunt undulated fiercely, their hold like the strongest of vices. “Fill me to overflowing... take what’s yours...” she both begged and demanded. </div>

When she finally reached her climax and her pussy started to milk him in that delicious way, he lost it too. With a roar of pleasure and a final thrust, his cock exploded inside her, filling her with his seed just like she wanted.

Mors had to close his eyes while he was feeling the shocks of pleasure rushing over his body. With a groan he pushed his face against her neck, resting against her while he calmed down and finished emptying inside her.

After a few minutes he had calmed down to start thinking again, he wrapped his arms around Iri&#39;s body and turned around, pulling her with him so now she was the one resting on top of him, &quot;You conquered me again in that jungle little moon... I was a fool to forget you...&quot; Was the only thing he said after a while, his eyes still closed while he enjoyed the moment with his pretty elf. In that moment he decided that he needed to find more information on what he was... It was important, he couldn&#39;t forget again and he didn&#39;t know if his children could suffer from the same idiotic thing. </div>

She was bombarded with his warmth, his touch, that way he smelled that filled her with delight. The girl shivered then, hugging him tightly, as he squeezed back and rolled her to be above him. 

With reddened cheeks, Iri propped herself up a little and looked down into Mors’ eyes. “I... I’ll conquer you as many times as I must, my beast. We are one. My body, mind and soul will always cry out for you. No other.” Her admission hung heavy in the air, truths and sincerity—love—dripping from every word. 

“What are you thinking, my beast?” Iri then asked of Mors. Her hands reached up, gently caressing his cheeks, slim fingers finding his hair. “Please tell your little moon.” The girl then leaned close, her soft lips finding his, as she sighed with happiness against him. </div>

He kissed her back, his arms tightening against her body and his big hand softly played with her hair. &quot;The future. About our children...&quot; He answered her after breaking the kiss and opening his glowing eyes to look into hers, &quot;I was thinking that I&#39;m something different, not common... I come back every time I fall, stronger but a piece of me is lost. We don&#39;t know if that could happen to our children... <em>And only a fool would keep going forward without knowing every outcome...</em>&quot; He told her, practically growling the last part as he felt his wrath rising for a second, mostly at himself but then he sighed, calming down a little and kept talking in an almost tired way, &quot;We can&#39;t let our children get lost like it happened to me...&quot; 

<em>At least not until they would be strong enough to take care of themselves.</em> He almost said but he knew that even then his amazing mate would never stop looking for them, and neither would he. &quot;I don&#39;t remember where I come from, who are the ones that birthed me... That could happen to them too.&quot; He finished his confession to her, if he were capable of feeling afraid then he knew that this would be one for him, losing his family like he lost his past. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Irithriel nuzzled Mors’ neck, while listening to him speak. He was often taciturn, speaking only when he decided it mattered. So when he bared his soul, revealing a dark and deep seated fear, her heart longed for him all the more. “Oh my beast,” she whispered against him, giving him feather light kisses of reassurance. 

Propping herself up, Iri looked deeply into Mors’ eyes and nodded. Her hands continued their play in his hair, a little something to provide him the extra bit of comfort she knew he needed, but would never mention. “We won’t let them. We will figure everything out as a family.” She nodded more vigorously. “Though, I honestly believe that, no matter what, our family will always find a way. Together we will learn what we can, prepare as able. Perhaps we can search in the library or ask the greens to speak to those you met in the jungle.” The girl smiled at him, the love she felt for him very evident in her shining gray eyes. 

Once more, Iri leaned close and kissed Mors’ neck, his jaw, his cheek. “And I will not allow you to forget, my beast. I promise you that. The same goes for our children. I’ll die first... if it comes to that.” She sighed softly then, her expression turning thoughtful. “Maybe we can speak to the healer again. Perhaps he will have an idea about you or where to start so we can get answers. We will find them, my beast.” At that, she cuddled close to the goliath and hugged him tightly. </div>

When she cuddled him again he closed his eyes smiled, his hands kept caressing her body while he just enjoyed the moment in silence. After a while he pulled the covers over them to keep her warm and comfortable.

&quot;Yes, we will find answers.&quot; He said completely sure of his words because failure was not an option, also because he remembered something. &quot;Do you remember what happened after the battle against the wooden beast? The battle master knew of the minions, he said that I was an overlord without minions, I didn&#39;t understand but now I know. Since I found the assasins I can feel it, now I can summon them to my side no matter where they are, pull them from our kingdom and bring them here with my power. He knew.&quot; And he had answers, &quot;Maybe the healer could he useful too.&quot;

&quot;But let&#39;s not worry about it for now.&quot; He finally said and moved his hands to her face, so he could look into her eyes again, no matter what happened he would make sure that no one touched his family, not his enemies, not even the fools that abandoned her before.

But then he remembered something, the one that took him down in that cave. &quot;What happened after the cave?&quot; He practically growled the question, if he find out that his mate was hurt them he would go back and destroy them all, specially that blue woman that took them to that trap. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">“Wooden beast?” Irithriel asked, a little unsure. The girl pursed her lips into a fine line, as she tried to recall what Mors was talking about. “I do recall you disappearing inside the cave after we fought some wolves. I ran after you, but it was like you’d vanished somehow.” She tilted her head a little, remembering their journey, as they’d helped Taff. 

“The lot of us became trapped inside the cave, but I’d managed to make Taff believe in herself and her magic. It hadn’t been easy. For some reason she’d decided her fighting skills and magic were useless, so she refused to try. But I’d managed to get her to believe in herself and create an ice ladder.” Iri smiled at the memory. “We all climbed it and then ended up in the jungle.”

That time seemed so long ago now. A distant memory. But she remembered every detail like it had happened the day before. It had been hard being parted from her mate, her sole mission to find him once again. “We met a woman named Pauuva. She knew you and somehow teleported Taff away and...” The girl’s voice trailed. “And we met your mother and father—Khos and Brandy. Taff’s fianc&#233;, Bors, is actually your brother.” Her face reddened, as she shared this information. “I then met your grandfather. You bear his name. Did you know that?” she asked of her mate. “He refused to show me where you were and said it would be my trial to find you. He also said you were wrong somehow, though I’m not sure what he meant by that,” she further admitted. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Iri sighed softly then. “Knowing I wouldn’t succeed on my own if I’d tried right then, I went back to the ship and recruited anyone willing to help me. It hadn’t been easy and... and during the journey, most had abandoned me entirely in some way... though perhaps they’d just been frightened and therefore unwilling to try and understand. I honestly don’t know. No one tried to injure me until... well... you saw what happened on that bridge.” Tears welled in her eyes, a few spilling down along her pale cheeks. Quickly, she wiped them away. “But in the end, I found you and you returned. I hope that means I succeeded in my trial, though I don’t fully understand what that meant either. Your grandfather wasn’t very forthcoming with explanations.” </div>

When she finished talking and he had calmed down, he finally started to process her words,<em>Brandy... Bors...</em> <em><strong>Khos</strong></em> those names, specially the last one awakened something in his mind.

He quickly sat up on the bed, his arms still wrapped around his mate so she was still plastered against him. He closed his eyes and frowned, his mouth opened and without noticing he started to speak in giant, <span class="spoiler spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"><span class="spoiler-text">&quot;Khos... Son of Mors... I fell where the giants rest... Stone by blood...&quot;</span></span> 

Every word he said brought more and more anger to him until he said those final words that made the markings on his chest glow in an evil green light like his eyes and his aura exploded around them. He opened his eyes and looked down at his little elf, &quot;<span class="spoiler spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"><span class="spoiler-text">Khos...</span></span> Him and the old giant were there, in the river. We fought while the old man watched. The mountain gave him power and I fell... But I came back. So I&#39;m his young? At least he&#39;s strong.&quot; He said to her, his anger mostly directed at himself for losing against his father. Some day he would get his rematch but he remembered the challenge, he accepted so it was not betrayal like his first death. </div>

He had no plans to return there in the near future, not while his mate was pregnant. &quot;Maybe someday we will return there but for now let&#39;s leave the fools with their mountain. They never found me, you did.&quot; He growled and kissed her. Hard. Showing her that his wrath, the thing that fueled his power and most of the time made him go against the world, turned into something else when it was directed at her. Not even his evil power would hurt her or try to bring fear to her like it did with every other creature but his minions. <em>Love.</em> That&#39;s what the stories called this feeling but for him felt different, maybe because he was twisted like the old one said but he didn&#39;t care, <em>It is what it is.</em> He thought and just kept kissing her. </div>

How she hoped one day they’d piece his memory back together. She knew it must be possible, since he’d been able to return to her. 

“We will... when the time is right,” Iri reassured. “Though no matter what, I’ll always be by your side.” The girl smiled sweetly at the goliath, her hands caressing his face. “So whatever comes our way now, well... we face it together. Nothing can separate us even if it might try.” She blushed prettily, leaning to nuzzle Mors with great affection. 

Iri felt Mors’ hands moving over her body, petting her back with as much love and affection and tenderness, as she felt for him. With a soft sigh, she easily succumbed to his kiss, welcoming his lips the moment they captured hers. His kiss was fierce. Bold. But she expected no less from her beast. It was his raw passion. Some called it evil. Others regarded it as twisted and wrong. But she knew better. This man just had so much to give to those who genuinely loved him. And she loved him wholly and completely, without any condition at all. She was his and he was hers and that made him absolutely cherished in her eyes for forever. 

“I love you, my beast,” Iri whispered, almost breathless. “Proud to be your mate and wife, the soon-to-be mother of our children.” </div>

His arms tightened around her small body and he stayed there while waiting for his wrath to calm down. Little by little his marks stopped glowing and his evil power receded back to his body. &quot;Apparently I remember how to speak the old tongue... One more thing to teach our children.&quot; He said while moving his face to her neck and starting to nuzzle her while trying to remember more things and managing to remember that the marks on his body were important.

After finally calming down he moved his head back and looked at her again, his eyes still glowing but not as intense as before. &quot;These marks...&quot; he started, grabbing one oh her hands and putting it over the marks on his chest. &quot;They were different, they made me part of the primal tribe and gave me power from <span class="spoiler spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"><span class="spoiler-text">the mountain</span></span> but now... they show my own power since I came back the first time...

Markings, while strange, that were also another part of him that she loved. “We will definitely teach our children your language. They will be well versed regarding where they are from. We’ll make sure of it.” The girl nodded and then smiled reassuredly. 

As Iri continued tracing her fingers along Mors’ chest, she sucked in a sharp breath. “Y-yes,” she started, answering his question. “Though I am elf, I am also dragonmarked.” She sat up a little and turned for her mate to get a good look at her lower back. “My mark,” she explained. “You probably thought it to be just a pretty tattoo, a mere decoration or something of the sort, but...” She shook her head then, snowy locks swishing about her pretty face. “It’s not. It’s a mark of shadow passed on through my lineage. You’ll notice it’s gotten larger since you’ve gone and returned.” Her face flushed then, growing rather hot. “It will grow a bit more and then stop,” she went on. “But it lets all elves marked by the dragon know we are kin.” </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Mors nodded his head and groaned in understanding, from what he remembered her mark sounded like his, just that her family was marked by a dragon while his was marked be the mountain. 

He grabbed her hips to keep her steady while he used his other hand to softly touch her mark, noticing that it had changed. &quot;A mark of shadows... Interesting.&quot; Was the only thing he said for a while, then he wrapped his arms around her again and pulled her against him. He leaned back again and pulled her with him so he was spooning her from behind, a small growl of pleasure leaving his chest from the feeling of just being together.

&quot;No matter what, we will be ready.&quot; He whispered in her ear and kissed her neck in reassurance, even though the one that was worried in the first place was him. &quot;This ceremony of our joining will the start of our own family.&quot; He said while one of his hands rested over her belly. &quot;What have you planned for it so far, little moon?&quot; He asked her, to know what was she thinking and to enjoy the lovely sound of her voice. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Irithriel nuzzled close to Mors, as he held her. His body was warm and made her feel both safe and content. With him, she’d always be ‘home’. As his hand moved to her belly, her own hand rested on top of his. She smiled then and glanced over her shoulder briefly before settling even closer, their bodies molding together like puzzle pieces. 

“I’ll never doubt anything, so long as we’re together. We’ll be a strong family. I already love it so much.” Iri’s cheeks reddened, her snowy head nodding when Mors spoke. His words touched her deeply, making her heart flutter and her skin grow slightly warm. 

“So far, I’d just like whoever from our guild wishes to attend to do so. It will be simple enough. You. Me. And the healer presiding. And... we can say our own vows. Something from the heart.” She bit down on her lip, her eyes finding some distant spot to focus on. If Mors could see her face, he’d notice her worry that he might not like doing such a thing. To ease her own insecurity, she cleared her throat. “Also, I would love a celebration afterwards, but nothing like what I’d known in the Feywild.” Her face reddened even more. “We can have friendly tournaments like you like, a nice meal and desserts.” She giggled softly at the thought of sweets. Her sweet tooth had gained some notoriety. “Just a nice time with those who’d like to share the day with us. What do you think, my beast?” </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Mors had his eyes closed while he listened to her voice as she talked, his right hand tracing small patterns over her belly where their child was growing. He loved to just listen to the sound of her voice while she talked, specially when she ended up giggling like that. The big giant smiled and waited a few seconds before answering, &quot;It&#39;s a good plan. It will be our day.&quot; His voice carrying the happiness he was feeling in that moment, also he was secretly glad that he won&#39;t be dealing with any feywild bullshit, he hated that place, the only thing good that had come from it was her, nothing else.

The overlord leaned forward a little to kiss the top of her head, &quot;We will start preparing things later. Now little mate, how are you feeling?&quot; He asked her softly while his hand started to roam her beautiful body, his touch still soft and he moved her a little so he could bury his face against her neck, kissing her lovely skin while he waited for her answer.

It was interesting, he noticed, if this moment had happened before, He would have just started to touch her in a way that would have ended with them becoming one again but now... Now he was holding back his own needs, specially after that talk with the healer. Now her comfort was one of his tops priorities, just below her safety. It was not that he didn&#39;t care before, he did but he was more aware now. Asking and making sure she was alright before just taking her body as he pleased, it was a strange change in him.... He was not even upset with himself, his whole being was in agreement with this change, he just noticed that it was interesting. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Irithriel relished the way Mors’ hands gently roamed along her body. Taking great care to acknowledge the little boy she carried, as well as provide her that attention of his she’d come to crave. The pretty elf cuddled closer, making soft noises that showed her approval of everything he was doing while they shared these moments together. 

“I’m glad you like it so far, my beast. I’ll have to see about the perfect dress to wear for you. For... us. I want it to be just right.” Iri’s blush deepened, her cheeks growing warmer still. She turned slightly, her head tilting so that Mors had even more access to her soft supple flesh at her neck. “Mm... that feels nice,” she praised, though her voice was a breathy whisper, her gray eyes closing so she could focus on Mors’ touches. 

When Iri opened her eyes, she bit down on her lip. Mors’ hands caressing and petting her was slowly causing that burn to well up inside her again. Swallowing gently, she could already feel her clit beginning to swell. Unable to hide it, the girl groaned softly and turned to face her mate. “I’m feeling well, my beast. Perfect actually.” Her lids lowered a little and she felt her legs spread in invitation. In her current state, the moment her legs opened, she could smell her own scent beckoning her mate home. “I... I...” she suddenly stammered, slightly surprised at these new things she could experience now that she was pregnant. “I need you, my beast,” she whined in a whisper, legs spreading further. “Please...” Her clit began to twitch, while her little hole began to slowly pulse its desire, readying itself in sweet anticipation. “I want to be one with you... please, my beast... I beg of you...” </div>

He wondered while he kept kissing Iri&#39;s neck and his free hand kept roaming her perfect little body. Never again he would forget, he vowed silently to himself while he turned around to face him.

Hearing her words and her need behind them he couldn&#39;t help himself and kissed her like the beast he was, devouring her pretty mouth and the sounds of pleasure she was making for him. He growled into the kiss and moved them so he was laying on his back with her on top of him. &quot;My beautiful mate, look what to do to me.&quot; He gronaed after breaking the kiss, grabbing her hips and moving her so his hard cock was rubbing between her legs. &quot;No matter what you wear, you will be glorious. And you don&#39;t need to beg me... Anything you wish, it&#39;s yours.&quot; His power leaked through his voice and glowing eyes at the end of his promise as he released her hips to let her take from him what she wanted.

Despite his words he grabbed he back of her head and pulled her for another punishing kiss while his free hand went to grab one her perfect breasts, no matter how much he touched her, it always felt like the first time... Like he wouldn&#39;t, couldn&#39;t get enough of her. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">It was humbling, bordering on frightening, at just how much power Irithriel actually had if she chose to wield it. But as the pretty elf looked down into her mate’s eyes, she knew in her heart that he held just as much power when it came to her. For theirs was not just a bonding between hearts... but between souls. The girl felt the heat prickle up along her skin, causing her body above to glow a decadent rosy red. She bit down on her lower lip, snowy waves spilling down along her body. She was an ethereal creature, her features that much more when seen against her mate’s. 

“I love you mind, body, and soul...” Iri whispered, her body arching, as her legs spread even further. Mors’ cock was teasing her now, threatening to fulfill its promise to stuff her full, the more she rubbed her hot and damp sex along its length. She groaned then, hips tilting so that she felt his tip tormenting her heaving entrance, so desperate for him, while the moments passed them by. 

Just then, Mors pulled her close, his lips crashing against Iri’s, while his one hand found her pert breast. Her own hands couldn’t help themselves, roaming his body with such needed urgency that she didn’t think they could join bodies fast enough. At that, she rocked her hips forward, Mors’ cock easily plunging deep within her warm, wet depths. “Nnnggg... Mors...” she moaned sweetly against his lips. Her hips bucked faster, needing him in ways she hadn’t thought possible. 

“Feels so good...” Iri then praised, her hips rocking faster, those slurping sounds of their coupling growing louder and making the room that much warmer. “Mmmffff...” she sighed, her little clit now aching unbearably, their bodies fitting together just as they’d been designed to be. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Mors was like the stories Irithriel likes to read to him, but he was no hero, or main character. No. He was more like the beasts or monsters the heroes had to conquer in order to reach the end. And like those beasts, he never thought he would end here, like this, with a lovely woman like her wanting to be one with him in such a true way. He had never understood what people called love, his being was so twisted that he just couldn&#39;t comprehend it.

He looked for the words to express what he felt back to her, he really did. But when she started to do as he said, to take what she needed from him. His mind just stopped. When her soft hands touched his body, his marks started to glow like welcoming her back. When he felt her wet heat around his cock, his power exploded again around them and his hands tightened around her.

His own groans of pleasure escaped from him between heated kisses and joined her lovely sounds of pleasure. And when she started to move faster he couldn&#39;t hold back any longer, despite his desire to let her take what she needed from him. After all he was a beast ruled by instinct.

With a growl he pushed himself up, sitting on the bed with his beautiful mate still riding him. His hands quickly went to her hips, to guide her movements and add more force to them while his mouth descended on her pretty breasts. Ruled by instinct and guided by her sounds he kept showing her what he didn&#39;t know how to express with words. </div>

She held such love for him and always would, her thoughts dwelling on nothing but the happiness and elation she felt every time they were together. Unable to help it, the girl felt warm tears forming in her gray eyes. It was an overwhelming sensation of raw emotion washing over her, her arms clutching her mate tightly, desperately. 

Mors’ growls and grunts were enough to excite Iri even more, spurring her on, as their bodies bumped together in a fast and furious frenzy. “Nnggg...” she groaned loudly, his hands gripping her hips, while his mouth assaulted her breasts. For a moment, she thought she might lose it, this barrage of sensation sending her into a spiraling abyss of pleasure and ecstasy. “Mors... nnnggg...” she barely managed, her hips bucking hard, despite his hold. 

Yes. Her Mors was her beast and she was his beauty. An unlikely pair that was so right no one could ever doubt their love for the other. Iri knew her beast wasn’t much for words, but every touch and gesture said it all. She would die for her mate... and now, her family. Never had life seemed so right and perfect. Sure, it had its trials and tribulations. But the pretty elf welcomed it all. At least now she knew what it was like to be loved and accepted, to know that despite her own flaws and idiosyncrasies there was someone who wanted her above everything else. It was humbling and wonderful and she wouldn’t trade it for anything. </div>

She arched then against Mors, her breasts presented even more for the goliath to take as he wanted. And she wanted him to take it all. Everything. She was his, as he was hers, and she wanted him to unleash that beast she knew he was. The beast she’d always want and love. </div>

It was amazing how well they fitted together despite being so different. They were from different planes, different races, different cultures but somehow they were made for each other. Of that he was sure since the beginning, but was reminded of that fact each time her hips crashed against his and he felt how the walls of her pussy squeezed his cock.

&quot;That&#39;s it little mate... Take what you need from me...&quot; He managed to say between groans of pleasure after his mouth finally released her pretty breast and started to move upwards. Despite being so lost in her, he noticed that she was a little different this time. More aggressive, like she had been starved for this, so he decided to pleasure her more.

He moved one of his hands so his thumb could rub that little bundle between her legs that he knew made her cry in pleasure. It was simply amazing to him how her body reacted to his every touch... How glorious she was at that moment... How in that moment, she came like him, a beast hunger for her mate. It was so much that he could feel himself growing more and more inside her, his body getting ready to give her what she was demanding of him. </div>

But when Mors reached down and began tormenting that twitching little nub between her legs, she lost it. Her mind went blank, as she cried out her pleasure. The girl arched hard against him, her cunt almost seizing about his cock. Those muscles gripped him hard, undulating at a feverish pitch, trying to milk him so that his seed would thoroughly drench her insides. 

“Nnggg.... Mors...” Iri rasped, her voice almost unrecognizable, as pleasure washed over her body. She convulsed above Mors, hands clutching him tightly, while her body shook and shivered. “I’m cumming, my beast!” she managed, though barely. It was hard to think straight when her body felt like this. “Fill me...” she both begged and demanded. “Please... I need it!”

Iri was a whimpering mess, as her hips went wild, grinding hard to make the pleasure wracking her body last that much longer. “Nnnggg.... nnngggg...” she moaned, sweat glistening along her rosy reddened skin. </div>

He roared as his body reached orgasm, his power also exploding around them, filling the space with evil power as he was filling her with his cum. His arms tightened around her body, plastering her bodies together. He didn&#39;t know how long they lasted like that, drowned in pleasure, he just surrendered to his base impulses and enjoyed it. 

When he came back to himself, he found himself with his face against her neck and his arms wrapped tightly around her body. He kissed her skin and with a groan he lessened his hold a little so he could look at her properly.  It didn&#39;t matter in what state she was in, every time his eyes landed on his mate the only word he could think that would describe her never changed. &quot;Glorious... And I had the foolish thought of trying to be careful...&quot; He said with a small chuckle, a rare smile appearing on his hard face.

He kissed her again, slower than before but trying to show her what he was feeling in that moment, &quot;I made you suffer... starve for me... Never again we will be separated.&quot; He told her between kisses, his unchecked power pulsing around them with each sentence. &quot;Good thing that old giant gave us those rocks... Now we can always find eachother easily.&quot; He told her after finally breaking the kiss to let her catch her breath. </div>

His words always had an effect on her, making her giddy and excited all rolled into one. She’d never tire of his praises, of knowing she made him happy. The pretty elf hadn’t known true happiness until him and now she’d never let it go. Her Mors would always know she loved him, appreciated him, and oh so much more. 

“Always so sweet to me, my beast,” Iri whispered almost shyly. Her lips curved into a sweet smile. “Now that we’re together again, nothing will ever part us. Not ever.” It was a promise, and one she’d do her utmost to keep. Her smile grew, her hands moving to push her snowy hair out of the way. She looked like an ethereal creature, as she looked down into his eyes, her tummy fluttering due to the love she held inside. 

“Yes,” Iri added. “Those stones were a generous gift. I’m glad we have them.” The girl nodded her head, white hair spilling down along her curves. “Though I’ve never used such things before. Have you?” she asked, bringing a hand down to rest upon Mors’ chest. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="24-Mar-20 10:37 AM">(edited)</span></div>

His marks stopped glowing, becoming black again and when he opened back his eyes they weren&#39;t as shiny anymore, they had returned to they usual dull glow. The change only took a few seconds so he kept talking, &quot;But somehow... I have the knowledge of how to use them.&quot; He finished and decided that a small practice would be the best way to explain how to use the sending stones. Then he carefully grabbed her hips, caressing her a little before carefully raising her up from his lap and separating their still joined bodies. 

He lowered Iri back on the bed and got up to grab the pair of stones before returning to the bed again. He sat on the edge and used one of his big arms to pull his mate sideways onto his lap again so he could show her how to use them. &quot;Pick one and just try to send your thoughts to me.&quot; He told her while opening his other hand so she could grab one of the stones he was holding. </div>

But she’d never fear her beast. No matter what, she’d always find solace in his arms. When he settled and shifted her off his lap, she had to stifle a moan. Luckily, the separation was short and he pulled her close, the sending stones in his hands. 

Smiling, Iri took one of the stones and studied it. Her fingers gently moved over the thing until she held it up just as Mors had told her to do. She brought the stone close to her head, her gray eyes closing, as she willed her thoughts to the stone against her palm. 

Being so close to her mate, Iri was unable to control the thoughts that immediately went to the magical item she held. Her mind filled with both love and desire, an overwhelming need to just be with her mate for all time. She wondered just how much Mors would get from her thoughts. Would he sense her emotions and feelings? At that, she bit down on her lip and winced, realizing that her worries and anxiety would also flow to him since she still held the stone and hadn’t stopped willing her thoughts to the stone. </div>

With a raised eyebrow he looked at his own stone and noticed that it was almost active, the carved symbol on the smooth stone glowing only a little. He focused on his own stone and noticed the problem. The connection was established, meaning that she was focusing on him but nothing was coming through, <em>Interesting.</em> He thought to himself when he noticed that he had the knowledge of what was happening with the stones, meaning that maybe he was familiar with them before he lost his memories.

&quot;You are focusing too much and not enough little moon,&quot; He said and then finished by using the stones to speak directly into her mind. <em>It&#39;s not that hard, you need to only send me a message, a clear one with words, like writing a letter. Like this.</em> </div>

Holding it up to her head, she cleared her mind and let the warmth building inside just wash over her. 

“Right...” Iri mumbled, her smile growing. <em>’I understand, my beast,’</em> she thought. <em>’I’ll get familiar with these. I will make you proud.’</em> Just then, she giggled and reached for Mors’ hand. Her palm slid against his, fingers slowly entwining. <em>’Are you hearing my thoughts now?’</em> she then inquired, but only in her mind. <em>’This is exciting if this works and... and... I love you, my beast.’</em> </div>

He looked into her eyes and raised his hand to softly caress her cheek, he just couldn&#39;t stop touching her. &quot;Yes it worked little moon... You also need to remember that it needs to be a short message, only five and twenty words can go through before the stone breaks the link. A message and an answer, that&#39;s all they can do before they need to recharge until next dawn.&quot; He told her softly before a memory flashed behind his eyes. 

One of him as a little boy, sitting on the mouth of a big cave while carving stones with his grandfather, &quot;<span class="spoiler spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"><span class="spoiler-text">They wake up with the mountain.</span></span>&quot; He grumbled in giant, echoing the words of the old giant without noticing. He blinked a few times and growled a little, dismissing the memory after the anger of his defeat against his father returned to him for a second, making his glowing eyes pulse for a second with his contained power. &quot;Next time we go there, we will ask the old man how to make better ones. Not powered by the mountain but by our own power, so we aren&#39;t limited like that. And we will have enough for our children.&quot; He told her, because no matter what happened in the future he knew that their little family would only keep growing, specially if their days keep ending up as this one, naked and on their bed. </div>

The pretty heated trail could easily be seen, as she sat there still holding the stone. “Of course...” she mumbled. It was just too hard to contain the excitement she felt inside. But no matter. She was lucky enough to be loved by her mate—unwavering and unconditional love. She might have never been truly loved by her family, but they were her past and Mors and their children were her future. 

“It’ll be nice to get even better ones,” Iri agreed. Mors was right in that they’d be both useful and helpful for their whole entire family. The idea that they’d be able to communicate to their children using such magical items made her feel that much easier as a soon-to-be mother. “Though it’s fascinating that such things even exist at all. Do you know how they were made?” she then asked, nuzzling the goliath, her one hand moving to rest against her belly. “Do you think you’re family will approve of us and our children?” It was an afterthought, a result of Mors mentioning his parents. The girl hoped his kin would welcome them all... one big happy family. Forever. </div>

I remember him telling me how hey worked but I can&#39;t remember the whole process how they were made...&quot; Finally he opened his eyes again and kissed Iri&#39;s forehead, &quot;You don&#39;t need to worry about what those fools think little moon... But you helped that useless blue woman and also conquered a challenge of your own... And all that while being with child. They should be proud.&quot; He told her softly while tightening his arms a little around her, enjoying just being close to her and their child.

&quot;One day we will return and they will see.&quot; They will see the greatness of his family, he would show them that he didn&#39;t need their strange mountain to he great. &quot;For now let&#39;s rest and prepare for our ceremony.&quot; He grumbled as he got comfortable on the bed, &quot;Tomorrow we can train if you feel like it little moon.

She hoped one day his memories might return to him properly, helping him sort out the fragments filling his mind and easing the frustrations she knew he felt. With a nod, she then smiled and looked up at him. 

It was nice being loved by someone, especially when without condition. Iri felt like the luckiest person alive knowing that she and her mate shared their love and lives as they did with each other. It only made her that much more eager to be his wife. 

“They <em>will</em> see, my beast. Perhaps my own family too.” Though Iri did her best to forget her own kin, those so willing to leave her abandoned, to leave her to an unknown fate... even death. It was still a hard reality to swallow. Her whole life, she’d longed for one kind word from them, just some bit of acceptance. But it never came and never would. 

“I’m excited for our day, my beast,” Iri then said, trying to distract herself, though also elated to plan and experience their special day. “It will be lovely and I can’t wait to tell stories to our son.” Her hand moved to her belly. “And our son likes the idea of me training,” she added, her smile growing, as she looked up into Mors’ eyes. </div>

A good training was always good and he missed the feeling of swinging his hammer around. Still, it had been an eventful day and it seemed that little by little spending time with his mate was helping him remember what he had forgotten when he fell the first time.

While he waited for sleep to take over him, he kept softly Iri&#39;s body, enjoying the feeling of having her in his arms. He was a fool for letting himself forget this and now with a child on the way he needed to get stronger so he won&#39;t forget again.

He opened his eyes and immediately noticed the absence of his little elf but he was not worried because now he had his wild soldiers that could protect her around the ship.

<em>It&#39;s peaceful to not have constant flashbacks popping into my mind each second.</em> He thought as he got ready for the day. Today they would make preparations for the ceremony and have some training, so he was sure he would find his mate wandering around the ship, but first he needed to check on the little idiots to make sure they stayed on their best behavior the next few days.

Finally picking his Warhammer and shield, and letting his evil aura expand a little just for the fun of it, he started to head to <span class="mention">#gardens</span> where he was sure he would find some of his green minions and with luck the blue ones too. </div>

The girl hadn’t adjusted to the latest changes due to her new condition. But she would. She just needed a moment and then all would be right as rain. </div>

Quickly the shadows around started to move and bend a little thanks to his presence. &quot;Interesting...&quot; He grumbled while looking around, his new vision letting him notice things about the dark room that he hadn&#39;t before.

He moved to his corner and dropped the heavy armor besides the hammer and shield. The minions had done their job properly at last, even his pack was there, dry as it should.

&quot;Take these to the skeleton. These are for the ceremony.&quot; He ordered and two green minions dropped from the ceiling before grabbing the basket and leaving the room.

After the door was closed he took off his helmet and was about to remove the boots when he heard Irithriel panting. Quickly he moved closer and kneeled in front of her so she wouldn&#39;t need to strain her neck to look up at him. Even kneeling he was a head taller than her sitting on the tall bed. &quot;Are you alright little elf?&quot; He asked her, one of his hands moving to her belly. </div>

He’s growing so well.” She was beaming, her other hand moving atop his. “It just takes a bit more energy to do things,” she explained. “Not that I mind, of course.” She giggled then, watching the little greens leave with the flower basket. “So don’t you worry about me.” The girl kissed him then, sighing prettily after tasting his lips against her own. Truly, her life was rich and full, so much more so than it had been back in the Feywild. To think she’d originally feared the worst. Now she knew it was the best thing life could have granted, setting into motion a series of events she wouldn’t change for the world. </div>

No matter what he was doing, he was always aware of the life growing inside her and he couldn&#39;t stop being amazed hot such a small creature like Irithriel could do something as amazing as providing him, an evil giant, such a strong atrong child that he could even feel the faint whispers of his power brushing against his own.

Despite the hunger he felt for his mate, he took his time. Without stopping the kisses he carefully moved his hands to take off her footwear and started to use his big fingers to massage her dainty little feets. &quot;Just say the word and it shall be yours.&quot; He declared after leaning back from her mouth. The words echoing around them like a Kings decree and he moved to kiss her pretty feet, worshipping her like the queen she was. </div>

How someone so strong and powerful could find it within himself to choose her. Dote on her. Give her everything he could. It was truly humbling. “Oh, my beast...” she then whispered, able to feel his power emanating from him, swirling with her own shadow magic of the Feywild. 

Irithriel watched Mors for a moment, heat spreading throughout her body. Every gentle caress sent her senses reeling, her body declaring its need for its mate. “You give me so much,” she managed to say, her body relaxed before him. Her skirts had ridden up her body, the flesh of her thigh visible to his eyes, if he chose to look. “Mmm...” She reached down then, hands finding his hair. 

“My beast,” Iri went on. “Would it be too much to ask you to hold me. To embrace me tightly within your arms? Mother of your child. Wife of a true King.” And she meant that. To her, Mors was a king. The only king she’d ever follow. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="25-Jun-20 12:27 AM">(edited)</span></div>

He kissed her swollen belly a couple of times before pulling back and removing his pants and boots.

Now as naked as she and obviously aroused because when wasn&#39;t his cock hard as long as she was near him? Never that&#39;s when. He gathered her in his strong arms and moved them both to the middle of the bed, him spooning her small form and his rough hands roaming her body and his big cock pushed between her thighs.

After a while of just enjoying her in silence. &quot;Soon our hands will be full with this one.&quot; He told her, after a sudden memory flashed behind his eyes. It was one of his own parents taking care of a couple of babies, him holding a toddler in his shoulders. Perhaps the only one he still had that confirmed him that indeed he had fought his father in that mountain. He dismissed it with a growl, no time to think about that fool but secretly appreciating finally remembering his mother&#39;s face.

&quot;So we better enjoy while we can...&quot; He grumbled suggestively against her ear and started slowly thrusting his hips, making his throbbing member to rub against her own hot sex. </div>

She’d always love the way his hands felt upon her, his breath tickling her neck and making her body call out in need. 

Iri turned her head a bit, legs spreading, so that Mors had access to that glistening slit. The one that beckoned him home. “My beast...” she muttered. “I’m already wet for you.” She let her hips move back and forth over his cock, coating him thoroughly with her juices. “See, my beast? Do you feel it?” The more her hips moved, the louder those wet sounds became. 

“Mm...” Iri sighed, daring to reach down and coat her fingers with her juices, as the dripped along her thighs. She then brought up her fingers for Mors to see. “See what you’ve done, my beast?” she pressed, smiling. “I need you... please, my beast. Take care of me. Only you can ever take care of me.” </div>

It has been too long already since we were one...&quot; He grumbled against her hear, even if they had lots of sex what? Last night? So it had been almost a day. <em>Still too long</em> he thought has his hand moved downwards and found her soaked sex.

He had been planning to take his time with her but finding her so ready and needed just destroyed his plans, &quot;You never ceases to amaze me, mate.&quot;

Without wasting time he just grabbed his cock and pushed it inside her, filling her completely like always. He groaned in pleasure, it was always a perfect fit despite their sizes. &quot;Always so perfect... It this what you wish? For your mate to fill you up?&quot; His hands moved upwards and grabbed one of their breasts, his other arm still just working as her pillow. He noticied her reactions to his exploration and findound that she had become more sensitive.

It always felt so good when his large cock stretched her, filled her, found its home within the warm, wet depths of her cunt. The girl arched her back a bit, hips tilting, so Mors could go deeper still inside her. “Nngg...” she groaned, then gasping softly when his hands found her breasts.

Iri felt her face grow hot, Mors touch causing her to leak a bit from the nipple. She glanced over her shoulder then, looking at him with worry and embarrassment. Surely this new turn of events would disgust the goliath. “I... I’m sorry, my beast... I... cannot help it.” She then looked away, feeling ugly for the first time. “If it displeases and you wish to stop... I’ll understand,” she went on, trying to give her mate the option. The last thing she wanted was for him to be uncomfortable. 

While waiting for a reply, a thin ribbon of milk barely wet Mors’ large fingers, the sensation of him touching her making her clit ache unbelievably. Iri was beside herself, hips still moving, though she braced herself for the worst. </div>

He felt it too, the small stream of liquid coating his fingers but didn&#39;t think much about it. &quot;Sorry about what?&quot; He wondered, his hips starting to move with hers in that delicious way they always did. &quot;For being always so wet and needy for me?&quot; No it wasn&#39;t that because that&#39;s how it had always been from the beginning. Him always ready to take her and her always ready to receive him. &quot;Or... is it about this?&quot; He growled in his ear at the same time he squeezed her breast a little more, making more of her milk to leak out.

He growled in frustration then, carefully pulling his cock out of her before turning her around so they were face to face. He pulled her against him, mindful of her swollen belly and pushed his forehead against hers, keeping as much skin constant as he could. &quot;What you need to understand my mate... In that nothing about you shall ever displease me.&quot; Without waiting for her to say more nonsense he hooked her leg on his hips, opening her up so he could easily push inside her again, filling her completely with him. </div>

But the moment she saw his face, it began to melt away. His words only melted it more, replacing that panic with a welcoming heat. 

Iri nodded then, watching as Mors positioned himself between her legs, one hooked over his arm. When he slowly sunk into her depths, she let out an audible hiss. “You are wonderful to remind me, my beast,” she whispered, happy tears now rolling down her cheeks. 

All that fear and worry was gone, that fire ignited deep in her core. “Then take me, my beast. Show me your raw power...” Her hips bucked up to meet his, crashing against him in a wet sounding thwack. The bed creaked beneath them, the headboard also bumping the wall. But she paid it no mind. She was with her mate. Her love. The other half of her soul. At that, she let out a loud and needy moan, hands grasping at him, urging him not to hold back. </div>

&quot;Yes little moon... I will...&quot; He practically snarled and the marks on his skin ignited with that evil green, his movements becoming more and more wild and powerful. He wasn&#39;t holding nothing back anymore since his power was settled and he was in control again.

He pushed her legs even wider, allowing him to go deeper inside her amazing channel. &quot;It&#39;s been torture... Holding back from making you mine... Like this...&quot; He managed to say between sounds of pleasure. Releasing her legs, he sneaked his hands under her back and pullings her against him and moving his mouth downwards until he found her leaking breasts. &quot;These will feed our young...&quot; He said with reverence after sucking one of them and tasting her milk for the first time. While it didn&#39;t have a strong taste he found that he liked it. &quot;So glorious...&quot; Like everything about her was. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Mors was buried deep inside those warm, wet folds, her body beckoning to be one with her mate. Looking up at him, she felt her mind full with swirls of pleasure, everything somehow right the moment they shared such moments together. Irithriel felt humbled watching her mate, the way he looked at her making her pleasantly warm. 

“My darling beast...” Iri whispered, her hands lost in his hair, Mors mouth working its way down her body until... suddenly he was suckling her breast. The one that had leaked only moments ago. At first she was surprised by his action, but soon it gave way to something else. Something more. The girl could feel his mouth somehow kneading the soft mound, encouraging her stiffened nipple to express more of her milk. 

“This pleases you, my beast?” Iri panted, soft little mewls rolling over her lips at how good it felt. It didn’t take long for Mors ministrations to get her cunt worked up more, hips rising and falling, her clit begging for sweet release. “Mmfff... feels so good...” Just then, she clutched at her other breast, the sudden pressure making that one leak in turn. Never had she known pregnancy would change her body in such ways. Never had she known her mate would enjoy these temporary changes. 

“Mors... Mors...” Iri cried out, her body now needing her mate more than ever. Like he’d said. It had been too long. Their bodies designed to be joined, to mate, to enjoy. Her hands moved over his back, settling on his backside, urging him on. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">After thoroughly enjoying one breast, Mors switched his attentions go the other, needs to prove her that everything about her was glorious.

One of his hands mirrored her own and settled on her hips while the other kept supporting her back, his big fingers easily reaching her backside. Even lost in his list for his mate, he was making sure to take as much strain as he could from her pregnant body. It wasn&#39;t even a conscious through, just his Goliath instincts taking care of his mate.

With his new grip keepings her in place, his thrust became more fast and hard, making the bed crash hard against the wall. It wasn&#39;t long before he could feel both of their bodies reaching that peak of pleasure. &quot;Yes little moon!&quot; He practically roared after releasing her breasts, his hips crashing inhumanly hard against her. &quot;Can you feel it? How glorious it is to be one? How this can never change?&quot; He growled in her ear so not even her sounds of pleasure could mask his echoing voice. He knew that she had doubts sometimes thanks to her foolish family and one day he would show those fools the mistake their had made. &quot;Feel how everything about you was made for me... How everything about me was made for you...&quot; He had pushed their chest together so she could not only hear but feel his words and groaned at the feeling of the leaking breasts being squeezed against his hard chest. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Irithriel nodded between pants, moaning softly with each thrust that Mors made. “Yes, my beast... nnnggg... I feel it...” And she did. Each and every time. How silly she’d been to doubt herself, allowing those horrible words uttered by Vae, by Evindal, the courts... the neglect of her parents. Of everyone. She’d been silly to let them dictate her life, her feelings. She was one with her mate now and no one would ever make her feel unwanted or lesser ever again. 

“Mors... nnngg...” Iri groaned, her body, even in its condition, fully accepting the raw power of her mate. Pressed tightly against him, she felt ribbons of milk leak between them, making a mess of their sheets. But the pretty elf hardly cared. Mors thought she was glorious, with him she was beautiful and strong. Beloved. 

Overcome with emotion, Iri’s hips moved faster, harder, meeting Mors’ pace and then some. Her forehead touched his, gray eyes unblinking, staring back into his. Into his soul. She could feel the wave of pleasure building, ready to crash upon the shore with a mighty resounding roar. Finally, she cried out, her cunt suddenly gripping his cock, muscles spasming, feverishly milking him and drawing him deeper. </div>

While they both climaxed he gave her a couple more of deep thrusts and stilled inside her, feeling that glorious pleasure wash all over his body. &quot;Glorious...&quot; Was the only thing he said before starting to shower her with kisses, his arms wrapped around her small frame and keeping them tightly joined, like always his big cock was still rock hard inside her thanks to his goliath endurance. Still, this soft touches were his own way to help her come down from that intense pleasure, remembering that their child made things more taxing for her.

&quot;My glorious mate.&quot; He praised her before taking her mouth in his for a couple of deep kisses. &quot;No matter how your body changes... How many times I forget... This shall always remain the same.&quot; It was his own way of showing how he felt for her. She always used the word love but to him that didn&#39;t compare to what they had, specially now that their family was growing.

He chuckled then, moving one hand between them and gathering some of her spilled milk in his fingers, &quot;It&#39;s a bland taste, perfect for a child.&quot; He made a little show of licking his fingers before gathering some more and offering it to her. &quot;Want to try?&quot; He was a wild beast after all. One that could easily recognize the beauty of nature without being held back by society morals and he wanted her to be like that too, free of everything, sure of herself and him. </div>

I’ll try it,” she answered, leaning close and tasting her milk off his offered finger. She had to admit it didn’t taste as expected, but it also hardly tasted bad. It was definitely a bit bland, as he’d explained. But there was also a sweetness she hadn’t anticipated. 

While Iri sucked on Mors’ finger, she looked up at him with wide eyes. And as her milk lingered on her tongue, it made her wonder what her juices tasted like too. Finally, she released his finger with a small pop. “Mm...” she sighed. “Better than I thought.” The admission made her blush harder, her gaze averting, while she smiled. “I... I’m glad you like it,” she went on, leaning close so she could place her lips against his. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="26-Jun-20 02:51 PM">(edited)</span></div>

He didn&#39;t mind if she kept leaking milk on top of him. &quot;And how are you feeling now? Is our son still making you tired?&quot; He asked her softly, one of his hands moving to her belly.

Tired...” she admitted, scowling just a little. “And... sore.” The girl giggled softly then, her cheeks rosy and bright. “It feels nice though. I always love this feeling after we’ve joined.” Her fingers were tracing the markings on his body.

“Mhm...” Iri sighed, answering Mors’ question. “I believe so. Food needs to be made on the day, but Captain Clay said he’d see to that. He knows our tastes well, so I’m confident it will be wonderful.” Her smile broadened. Just then there was a jolt, the girl perking up when it happened again.

“Oh my beast! Did you feel that?” Iri squeaked. Again, there was that jolt and she noticed the slight movement of her belly. “Aeran is saying hello!” She pressed Mors’ hand flat against the spot where Aeran was kicking. </div>

Mors was literally stunned for a few seconds. Glowing eyes wide, hands unmoving as he felt their son movements for the first time. He couldn&#39;t even think, like his whole being was suddenly focused on just feeling the child kick and then wait for the next one.

After a couple of minutes he finally smiled, even chuckled some. &quot;Such a strong child!&quot; It was very obvious the happiness he was feeling right now. And no matter what his hand didn&#39;t move from that spot. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Irithriel was all smiles and giggles, elated how Mors was just as awestruck as she was. Both of them kept their hand against her belly for several minutes, Aeran kicking and nudging. Iri was certain it was their son’s way of saying hello and spending some quiet and quality time with them both. There was something comforting about the way the two of them just sat there together, cuddled up, while waiting for their son’s ‘replies’. 

“I... I am just... no words, my beast!” Iri wondered how much longer it would be before Aeran arrived. It also made her wonder about other things like—a cradle, clothes, nappies, and so many other things a baby might need. She wondered if the ship had such accommodations and if there was a nursery somewhere should she and Mors need to take some time away, as they needed to make money. And they needed to forge ahead with their plans to secure the future they both desired. 

“My beast,” Iri then said, interrupting her own thoughts. “Do you suppose there’s a nursery on board? And... Aeran needs a cradle, and clothes, and blankets, and...” Her worry was evident. Would they have what they needed once their son was born? She certainly hoped so and would do her part to see that they did. </div>

Slowly he was feeling himself relaxing more and more, the quietness of the moment practically sending him into sleep when suddenly he heard his mate worried words and opened his eyes again. &quot;Do not worry my mate...&quot; He grumbled softly. &quot;After the ceremony we shall gather all of the things the child needs... And if there&#39;s no place where we can leave him we will just take him with us... Or let a couple of green ones handle him when he grows some.&quot; He tried to reassure her with his words.

He chuckled a little then, obviously half drunk as the sleep, &quot;The child probably would enjoy coming with us into danger when he grows up...&quot; Imagining himself showing their son how to make their enemies submit before their might. </div>

He is our son, after all.” The girl caressed her belly lovingly, little Aeran poking her and making her belly move, as if he agreed completely. “Aeran agrees!” she then exclaimed. 

With a soft sigh, Iri cuddled close to Mors, feeling better about all the things they still had to plan. Her mate was right. Everything would be fine. There honestly wasn’t a thing the two of them couldn’t tackle together. They’d proven that time and again since they’d found each other. 

Feeling content, Iri closed her eyes and just enjoyed the moment. Her body felt nice and she felt safe in Mors’ arms. There wasn’t a thing she wouldn’t change. Happy, the girl let her breathing slow, her body slowly giving into the exhaustion that did come along with pregnancy. “Mmm... I’m sleepy, my beast,” she slurred, her arms wrapping about Mors’ middle. “Perhaps... perhaps a small nap...” </div>

And even if he was somehow defeated, he would always come back because not even death can separate him from his mate and child... Or any future children they have in the future.

His last concious thoughts where on the ceremony, now thanks to the skeleton man, every fool on this ship shall know they belonged to eachother and see that they small family was growing.

Her fingers then moved over the cloth she’d draped about her shoulders. “I wonder what this does...” she mused aloud. </div>

Something about them made him remember a little forgotten piece of himself. &quot;It is said that through his life, Kunka managed to defeat several storms until one day, when he was old and weak. He made a small rowboat with the wood he had use to survive that first storm. Sailed by his own, and fired his gun at the sky one hundred times in a row, conjuring the biggest storm any sailor had ever seen. It lasted a week and after that, Kunka was never seen again.&quot; He finished the tale. His evil echoing voice easily filling the room.

The overlord frowned at himself. That was fucking weird, he thought. Those words coming to him but no actual memory being attached to them. He shrugged and walked towards his mate, easily picking her up in his arms and taking a seat in front of the healer and his mate. 

Mors kissed Iri&#39;s neck and his hands found her round belly, feeling their child. &quot;Now, we are not surrounded by idiots anymore. Tell me about how are we kicking those fools of your family out of our land.&quot; He told her. </div>

She didn’t know the half of it. Not only was their aunt a horrible person, but so were her parents. Or, they had been when still alive. She’d learned enough of her other aunt to know just how similar she’d been to her sister—Baron Elvinor Ellorenthi. 

“I’m sorry we come from such a terrible family, Selaphiel,” Hal then said softly, looking directly at her cousin. </div>

Then he went towards were his weapons were resting, leaving the warhammer there but grabbing his shield and giant sword. 

The overlord sheathed both of his shield and sword on her back thanks to this new armor the metal men had fashioned for him. The sword having a place to go on the backplate and the shield easily being hooked on top of the cape. </div>

Then he turned towards Hal, &quot;Don&#39;t worry first mate, If you explain to me the layout, we can figure out something...&quot; He told her and opened his hand, palm facing up. There a small shadow illusion of the fortress they had just raided appeared. He had a decent memory and spatial awareness. With enough info and the ability to project it with his shadow magic they may be able to work on a map. Then, they could try putting it on parchment. </div>

Mors and Irithriel certainly were a commanding pair, each one in their own way yet dragging people around with them. That at least, made him less worried about them taking that throne in the feywild. &quot;Alright, He should be well enough to receive visitors today.&quot; He said while standing up and offering his hand to Sela. </div>
