Blinking several times, she was unsure if she should turn around or proceed forward, though she suddenly became quite aware of the tears streaking her face. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="03-Sep-19 05:03 PM">(edited)</span></div>

Maybe this was one of them? She didn’t know. But the only way to tell was to try. “This ship,” she started. “Something just isn’t sitting right with me.

Specifically, a bracelet, a necklace with a crystal pendant, and a ring she knew was a map. “These,” she said, her breaths quickening, her hands shaking. “I got these from Parcival,” she explained. Her face twisted a bit. “When he owed me a penalty, he led me away to the treasury,” she continued. “He was careful in choosing my prize. And...” her face went white. “It almost felt like a threat or... maybe him conveying a darker desire? I... I don’t know,” she half explained. “But in the end, he gave me these.” She licked her lips, her mouth going dry, her fear only growing, terrified the spy master was nearby. Watching. “The bracelet is an arcane focus. It allows the caster to find a familiar. The necklace captures souls,” she said, once more shuddering as she spoke. “The ring is a map of The Storm Giant’s Falls. If you... look here...” She held it up so that Thorrin could see the topaz and diamond chips. “The topaz marks the town of Pioneer.” </div>

&quot;That seems very odd. The necklace is what seems out of the normal to me at least. I&#39;m not sure why he would give you such an item. The map is quite unique in itself ive never seen one like it. Perhaps they are items which should be used together for a greater purpose?&quot; </div>

She could suddenly feel the blood rising to her cheeks and wished she could pull her hood up to cover her face. No doubt her scar stood out even more now. “Thank you, Sir,” she said, smiling up at him. “I appreciate the kindness and your offer. I... I accept,” she said, grateful to have another who’d accompany her to Pioneer. She’d need the help and she worried about the dangers that waited for any who chose to follow. For those who chose to go up against the spy master. “It will be a dangerous path,” she warned. “I’m unsure of what this spy master can do or what he wants. But... I do believe all of it has happened for a reason,” she nodded. “We have the pieces. Now it’s time to start assembling the puzzle.” </div>

Markisa would step on board the Steel Heart having hitched a ride with the smaller airship now docked on board peddling her wares.

Her mission was clear.  Seek out an unregistered succubus whose master had broken the contract allowing her to run free.  This is one of the only known cases where a fiend has made a hope, an attempt of actually playing a hero.  If this succubus succeeds it might mean a whole new line of work for registered fiends on the material plane.  A great leap between mortals and fiends to help remove the stigma.

Now... to find her.  Her name is said to be Zia, information given to her from the intelligence for the Church. </div>

The breeze blew through her snowy hair, causing her shimmery gown to billow and flutter about her lithe body. Taking in the sights, she began to softly hum a soothing and enchanting tune.

The young elf stretched and yawned, running slim fingers through her thick, snowy hair. She giggled softly, as she pushed off the covers and swung her legs to the side of her bed. “Mmm...” she sighed, reaching for her pan flute and tucking in nicely into one of her pockets. The girl stood up and moved towards her door, eager to roam the strange ship some more. 

As Iri meandered down the corridor, she came upon the stairs leading to up above. She’d very much enjoyed that top deck, the view one of wondrously, breathtaking awe. Her hand slid along the banister, as she daintily made her way up... up... up. Once at the top of the stairs, she playfully peeked to see if she’d be alone or if others might have had the same idea as she—to take advantage of the glorious view the airship had to offer. 

“Brrr...” Iri shivered, as she crested the steps and made her way out onto the platform. The wind was cold, but invigorating. She felt so alive, so free. Immediately, the elf began to hum. Lightly skipping towards the railing, her shimmery dress billowing in the breeze, the silky material clung to her body. Tiny goosebumps formed along her arms, but she hardly cared. Her humming grew louder, her gray eyes suddenly catching sight of a very large man. She stopped suddenly, tilting her head, as she looked at him. Her smile broadened. “Hello,” she said sweetly, her voice an enchanting melody. “I’ve not met you yet,” she went, giggling. “My name is Irithriel.” She curtsied much like she’d done back in the courts of the Feywild. “Why do you look so sad?” </div>

Despite this man’s obvious uniqueness, he wasn’t like the creatures of the Feywild.

“Oh, you mean singing?” Iri laughed. She moved closer still, a delicate hand reaching out to gently touch him. “Hrm...” she pondered. “Because it’s beautiful,” she explained. “Just like this view!” The girl gasped, as she suddenly flitted to the edge and leaned over the railing. The wind whipped her hair and kissed her face, her eyes slightly watering from the chill. “You should try it, sir,” she laughed. “Try with me? Please?” she begged, lips moving into a sweet little pout. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Iri moved away from the railing and looked up at the very large man. Again, her pretty head tilted, her expression quizzical. “Hrmm...” she seemed to ponder, a hand moving to tap her chin before tugging gently on her lower lip. The elf giggled then, twirling gracefully before this peculiar brute. Her dress fanned out before her dance-like motions caused the liquid like material to swirl back around her body, hugging her curves once more. Her snowy hair seemed to float, as she danced—an ethereal little creature, so far from home. 

“Then let’s dance and sing?” Iri begged him, humming her earlier tune once again. She was glad this man liked music. He needed to dance, to smile! The elven girl’s humming eventually became words, sweet lyrics filling the area, a soft melody on the breeze. When the man just sat there, she couldn’t help but pout. Dancing her way closer, she encircled her arms about one of his. “Come dance with me?” she whined, tugging on him, coaxing him to engage in her play. “It will make you smile, whoever you are.” Again, she giggled, her lips puckered into a pout. “It looks like you could use some smiles.” </div>

But...” her voice trailed and she smiled again. “I think a stroll throughout the ship might brighten your day.” Her face flushed, a rosy pink blossoming over her pale cheeks. “If the pretty view of mountains and song cannot make you smile, surely that will.” The girl looked up at the man hopefully, biting down on her lower lip, while she shyly clasped her hands in front of herself and shifted slightly from foot to foot. </div>

The girl swallowed, when his tone became a bit more forceful. She then looked to the ground. He wanted her to sit on the dirty floor? Her pretty dress would get ruined! 

“Uhh... sir?” Iri squeaked. “But the floor is dirty.” The girl frowned, her eyes watering a little at the idea of dirtying her dress. Her hands moved to smooth out the silky material. It felt so soft against her fingertips. “I’m sure I could sit on the bench,” she suggested, though the massive man took up the entire thing. Looking down at the ground, she began to sniffle, a hand moving up to wipe at her eyes. “Why the ground?” she asked, looking up at him with a tearful face. </div>

She looked up at him, her cheeks going pink with frustration. Perhaps coming to this airship had been a mistake. Perhaps everything in her life had been one. She was suddenly reminded of her father’s shouts. Her brother’s. Even her mother’s. In that moment her heart twisted and a heaviness fell upon her. Her gray eyes fixed on her lap and she leaned back, the chilly kiss of wind dancing over her skin. She let out a soft sigh and began to sing. It was a haunting melody, one she recalled hearing as a little girl. Usually it brought her comfort. But right then it just made her realize how it was clearly impossible for her to fit in anywhere. Not anywhere. Ever. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="04-Oct-19 10:52 AM">(edited)</span></div>

But her song was interrupted, her gray eyes going wide, as she looked up at the man. Her spine stiffened and she bit down on her lip, while she listened. He suddenly seemed so much larger than before. 

Conqueror? Iri’s thoughts were racing and she remembered how her father and brother often spoke about safety and security, how to keep others from taking what they had. Was this man trying to take over the ship? Was he...? The girl’s thoughts were stifled, as crashes and cheers suddenly struck her ears. She peered around the man. Mors? That’s what the little creatures were calling him. Gasping softly, the girl stood up and went over to the little things that seemed happy to be in this sour man’s presence. 

“Mors?” Iri asked. “Is that your name, sir?” She smiled sweetly and pat one of the creatures on the head. Turning to the one closest to her, she giggled. “You just want the big brute to smile, don’t you,” she spoke, her voice going a bit higher, while she did. “I bet he has a wonderful smile,” she went on, and then turned towards Mors. “When he actually does.” At that, her own smile grew. 

Iri walked over to Mors, the man several feet taller than her. She craned her neck to look up at him. “So, Mr Smiley Face,” she teased, clearly able to tell he was embarrassed by these creature’s display and also desperately wanting to make him smile now. “Are you taking over the ship?” she asked, her gray eyes glittering with curiosity. “And how did you happen to find these little darlings?” </div>

He certainly seemed very cross. Perhaps... sad? “Hrmm...” she mumbled, walking towards the large man, as he slumped against the bench, his body taking up the whole thing. “Well, if this is your vacation, perhaps I can help you find some perspective.” Her smile broadened. “First off, you aren’t in a crazy place.” The girl glanced out at the beautiful mountain view. “Look around, there’s so much beauty everywhere and you’re on a magnificent ship!”

Biting down on her lip, Iri moved closer still. Mors still looked oh so sour. Like he would bite off the head of anyone or anything that crossed him. That was no way to be, while on vacation. She reached out and gently began massaging his temples. Perhaps a gesture of kindness could help. The worst he might do was yell at her again. She suffered as much from her own father and brother before she’d lost her way. The girl sighed, her lips pursing together, as she hummed. Oh! He seemed so tense! And this was his vacation! “You sure I can’t coax you into a turn about the ship?” she prodded, before slipping sweetly into song, her delicate fingers gently kneading his temples and then the back of his neck. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Iri nodded, while she listened to Mors. “Poor thing,” she said sweetly, her fingers continuing their work. “No wonder you’re so cross,” she giggled softly and went back to singing. Mors definitely didn’t look as scary with his helmet off. Perhaps it didn’t help that he wore such heavy armor. She imagined it would make his head and neck ache after a while. 

Unable to help herself, Iri beamed proudly, when Mors requested she continue. Her fingers searched out every knotted muscle, working them to help Mors find some peace. It made her happy to know that she’d finally done something right, something to help this sour man’s day improve—if even only by a little. 

“Well, hopefully this vacation ends better than the other ones,” Iri stated. She leaned towards the man’s ear and whispered, her breath warm against his ear. “If you like music, I wouldn’t mind playing or singing for you.” She stood back up, singing softly, as the cold wintry winds whooshed through the air, causing the young elf to shiver. </div>

His tone was rich and serene, as he spoke, the girl positively beaming at the unspoken compliments. She continued her song, fingers lightly touching his stiff and aching muscles. She was lost in what she was doing when suddenly those little creatures scampered towards them. Gasping softly, she stopped and stared, her lips curving up into a smile. 

“Escucha?” Iri asked, her brows furrowing. “What are the little dears saying?” she then asked, her hands by her side as she moved closer to one of the creatures. The elf squatted down a little, just watching their peculiar behavior. She then glanced over her shoulder at Mors. “ What are they doing?” she wondered out loud. “Is everything all right?” She then stood up and moved closer to the man. “Feeling a little better at least?” she asked, hoping that the odd behavior of these sweet little things didn’t mean trouble was on the horizon for this sad and cross man she’d just met. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="04-Oct-19 07:04 PM">(edited)</span></div>

                    <div class="markdown">Iri flinched. Was Mors teasing her, or was this just more criticism? It was hard to tell and she suddenly felt her chest begin to tighten. The elf imagined her father then, the way he’d look at her with disappointment. She’d always been considered unacceptable, a nuisance. No one ever took her seriously or considered her thoughts, desires, or needs. Of course, she was aware of her own shortcomings—easily distracted, talking too much. But just once... once! It would be nice to know this was all right. 

“Rarely,” Iri whispered. “Is... is that bothersome?” she asked, unable to look at Mors, as she did. She feared the worst and didn’t want to see that familiar look of disappointment in his eyes. She’d had enough of that over the years from her family. A family who would never accept her. A family she hoped could one day change their mind. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="05-Oct-19 04:31 AM">(edited)</span></div>

                    <div class="markdown">At Mors’ words, Iri lifted her head and looked up into his eyes. Her own had just started to water, but she’d managed to hold the tears back. Slowly, a small half smile crept along her pretty lips and the tightness she’d begun to feel in her chest was starting to dissipate. She gave him a nod, one of gratitude for sparing her, her feelings. No one besides her old mentor back in the Feywild had ever done as much. 

Biting down on her lip, Iri listened to Mors and turned to watch the little creatures. Their behavior was so odd and she couldn’t understand what they were saying. She squinted a little, gray eyes narrowing, as she tried to notice a pattern. Were they... making music? It seemed like it. But what had inspired such behavior? Surely, it meant something. 

“It looks like they’re making music,” Iri said softly, her eyes moving away from the creatures for a moment. “Similar to what some of the men played during battle back... home...” Her voice trailed. She no longer had a home back in the Feywild. The Steel Hearts was her new one. Until the guild master grew tired of her and cast her back out once more. “Is that what they’re doing?” she asked, her fingers nervously clutching the sides of her skirts. </div>

The girl moved to be closer to the little creatures, squatting down so she could be almost level with them. She giggled softly and began to sing along with them, while they provided the accompaniment. It was wonderful. Glorious. She closed her eyes and let herself get lost for a moment. When she opened her eyes back up, she turned to look at Mors, the large man seemingly lost in his own reverie. “What are you dreaming?” she asked him, her tone soft and sweet. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">He was speaking about conquering things again. Just why would someone want to do that? Iri thought about all the beautiful things she’d been lucky enough to see in her lifetime so far and tried to imagine someone or something trying to smother it, snuff it out. Did Mors not want to let the inner beauty of things shine and be free? The very idea was so very foreign. But it was also so very familiar...

“Me?” Iri stated, more than asked. “Well, honestly, I had no where else to go. No prospects.” She paused a moment, her hands moving to rub along the filmy material of her skirts. “I... I’d been separated from my family,” she explained, her lips moving into a small frown. She knew it had been purposely done. A lesson in life. A harsh reminder of just how useless she was. They’d moved on in the night, leaving her behind and in her attempt to find them, she suddenly found herself... elsewhere. 

“And I couldn’t find them or my way back.” It was clear Irithriel had been abandoned and left to her own devices. Her tone and expression filled in the gaps where words suddenly failed her. “But I was found by Mr Clay,” she continued. “And he offered me food and shelter. Camaraderie. He even said I could take jobs to earn a little money and...” The elf’s voice trailed, her voice faltering ever so slightly. She cleared her throat and then licked her lips. “And possibly even some favor. I’m certain that would make my family proud.”

Iri looked down at the ground, the weight of Mors’ gaze suddenly so very heavy. Would he judge too? Oh, he probably already did. No doubt he found her just as silly and useless as her family had. And, as she stood there, she knew she wouldn’t blame him if he did. </div>

Looking over at the tiny creatures and then back at Mors, Iri smiled softly. “I admire your courage and resolve,” she said, deciding he had tried to protect the little darlings and that was what drove him even if occasionally they embarrassed. It melted her heart. “I believe in you,” she said, meaning it. “After your vacation, I know you’ll succeed in this noble goal of yours.” Her smile broadened, while she nodded encouragingly, her delicate hand giving his arm a gentle squeeze of support and reassurance. </div>

She wasn’t used to anyone being truly pleased with her. It felt nice. Comforting. And more than anything, it made her feel a sense of worth. “Really?” she squeaked, her hand still resting against his arm.

When Mors then asked Iri to follow him, she felt a sudden lump rise in her throat, a sort of giddy excitement suddenly washing over her. Here was this great man choosing her to help him down along this noble path only someone like him could follow. Just then, the little darlings were cheering. It was as if they were encouraging her to nod and say yes! Her face growing warmer, the sweep of red blooming even more over her pale flesh, the elf turned towards him and whispered, “Yes...”

It had happened so fast, Iri still barely knew him. But for some reason her heart begged her to follow. “Yes, I will,” she said softly, her face alight, as she sweetly smiled up at Mors. “I... I promise to make you proud of me,” she offered, hoping with all her heart that she’d be able to. At that, she threw her arms about his neck and happily hugged him. </div>

The rosy complexion even reached the swells of her breasts, a tease of just how far it might reach. “All right,” she said shyly, sweetly, giving the large man a nod. 

Slowly, Iri shifted her body off of Mors’, brushing against him, as her feet slid to the floor. She giggled then and brought her hands back up to his neck, slim fingers working those muscles once more. While she massaged the man, she began to hum much like earlier, but it wasn’t long before she finally burst into song. Singing softly for Mors, she let her fingers get tangled in his hair, giving it a small tug, while she also massaged his scalp. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="07-Oct-19 05:38 AM">(edited)</span></div>

She paused a moment, hands going still, when the large man suddenly asked to know more about her. But she let her hands resume once again, those musician’s fingers playing his muscles so carefully and precisely. She truly hoped he was feeling better. 

“Me?” Iri asked out loud, her face growing hot. Suddenly, she felt embarrassed, worried. She’d just dedicated herself to this man and his cause. What would he think if he knew just how troublesome everyone found her back in the Feywild? It was bad enough he most likely knew she’d been abandoned. But what if he knew she’d also been ignored? Would he suddenly ignore her too? The girl’s face contorted briefly. She hoped he wouldn’t. His cause was noble. Worth following. It would be devastating if she was suddenly pushed away and discarded, as if she didn’t matter. As if she had nothing to offer. For once she was starting to feel as though she just might have purpose. </div>

A nervous twinge lacing her voice. “I’m from the Feywild originally.” She winced then remembering that Mors had initially seemed disgusted by her presence. Did he typically not enjoy the presence of elves? “Dangerous place so my father and brother have said. But I...” Her brows knitted together, as she remembered her family. “I come from a wealthy family, I suppose you could say. I had everything I needed and most of what I wanted.” Except love and acceptance. But this man wouldn’t want to listen to her tell him about that. “My family had high favor among the elf and fairy courts,” she went on. “But that also placed our family at higher risk.” The girl licked her lips, fingers tugging on Mors’ hair. “My parents and brother were always meeting with advisors. Planning. Strategizing.” She sighed softly. “And...” her voice faltered. “And having to apologize for me. I... I didn’t fit into the courts like they did. I tried using my talents to help boost their spirits, make them smile. But...” Her voice trailed. “In the end, I was just trouble for them. I hadn’t meant to be. I... I just wanted them feeling better.” As memories of being ignored and abandoned flooded her, she suddenly began to sniffle, desperately trying to hold back the tears. </div>

Mors saw her as more than she saw herself. Iri could tell. The large man was angry. Angry at her family and angry at her for letting their opinions dare to snuff out her light. She swallowed then, licking at her lower lips, before trying to steady her breaths. 

“Yes,” Iri whispered, her head still nodding. “I... I understand.” Her heart swelled that another saw her as valuable. Demanding she know the same. “I take your words to heart, my lord.” Lord? The word had come so naturally, the elf was shocked that she’d even uttered it. Perhaps it was all those years in the courts. Old habits dying hard? It was difficult to say. But she couldn’t take back what she’d said. And the more she thought on it... she didn’t want to. So the girl just continued on. “Thank you for letting me aid you in such a noble cause.” </div>

When Mors released her, she just curtsied out of instinct, though her expression soon turned thoughtful, as she went through all the things she’d learned about the ship—which hadn’t been much. At least not yet. 

“I’ve not been on board long. But I’ve met the guild master and captain Mr Cassius Clay, along with a few from his family. They seem a decent bunch even if they are no longer among the living. They took a chance on me, so they have my gratitude.” The girl pursed her lips then. “And I’ve only met a handful of the others on board. They all seem to be of the adventuring sort, so perhaps they are seeking some coin?” It was an educated guess, seeming to fit what little she could gather of the people. 

“Right now I know we are staying in this mountain region. Not sure for how long though. Or why the Steel Hearts have chosen here above all other destinations. Though it’s something I could find out,” she offered. Though she was a capricious girl, full of laughter and music... she knew when to hide, to listen, to make herself invisible in plain sight. It was a stark contrast to the girl she was, but a necessity to survive a life of nobility, the courts, and countless enemies scheming up your family’s demise. “Perhaps we could explore the ship?” she further suggested. “Have you gotten a room yet? I can show you mine. Maybe we can request that they are near to each other?” </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Irithriel nodded, snowy hair swishing about her pretty face. It made sense. Yes. Like her, Mors was quite new to the ship. Though she’d been on board a bit longer and had only just been given a room of her very own to call home. So of course he hadn’t received the generous offer. Not yet. But the elf knew for sure such a desire could and would be granted. “We can certainly talk to Mr Clay,” she said. “I’m sure he’ll help to accommodate us. I think the room next to mine is currently unoccupied now that I think on it.” The girl was practically beaming, looking up into his eyes with the sweetest of smiles. The idea of being so close to her new lord filled her with happiness and pride. It gave her a sense of belonging. A sense of meaning.

“Let’s explore the ship then,” Iri then stated, wanting Mors to be happy and smiling. She was determined to see that, to be its cause. Could she? In some ways it seemed near impossible. But now she’d dedicate her time to ensure it, even if it could never be. The trying alone would be worth it. “Where shall we start?” she asked, still blushing before him, placing her arm linked to his. He towered over her, but she hardly minded. The girl barely even noticed, too wrapped up in ensuring his vacation went exactly as the man had planned. </div>

Copper Pearl managed to gate herself onboard, but only on the outside.  A one use item to get to somewhere of safety and with her belongings slung over her shoulder in a duffle bag, the yuanti pureblood stepped into the gate and then landed on the polished deck of the airship.

Immediately she felt the chill of high altitude, immediately felt the wind blow through the tendrils of her &#39;hair&#39; and fins.  She raised a hand as she looked about her surroundings, covering her big eyes, a sword in her hand at the ready, a Great Sword with one hand.  

&quot;I know Darling I know.&quot;  She said to herself before she lowered her weapon when she realized she was alone.  The weapon disappeared into a puff of smoke, as she set the duffel bag on her shoulder before slithering her way to a stair well.  She needed to get inside.  And preferably not get hurt before she found the captain or whoever was in charge. </div>

Viola moved out of the way, seemingly in an almost unseen movement.  &quot;Thanks for volunteering.&quot;  Came a very confident and deepish voice for a lady.  &quot;You know how to aim a cannon?&quot;  She asked  putting a hand on his shoulder and setting him before a cannon with a bunch of unnecessary attachments too it.    There were wheels to move it up down, left right, a few dials for reading energy levels, pressure, heat, and finally a firing lever mechanism.

Other then those things, the cannon itself seemed...strangely more advanced then just a black powder ballistic.  The woman offered him ear plugs and goggles. </div>

Taking a few more steps, she found herself outside and peering out at the sights below. She gasped softly, the view quite breathtaking from way up high as she was. Carefully, she moved across the space, golden eyes noting these odd canons lining the way. Were they worried about being attacked? It was a lot to ponder and something she hoped was merely a safety precaution. 

Heaving a sigh, Sela’s thoughts moved to her brother. She’d been assured that Barachiel would be well taken care of. But even still, she wouldn’t be at ease until she was finally allowed to visit him... or he her. The two had a lot to discuss and plan. There was still that hag out there and the pair needed to find her and force her to free her twin from his curse. She wouldn’t stop until it was done... or she was dead. </div>

He has learned to stand back and watch, patience was the key to being ready for any situation, <em>&quot;never leave your post and when shit wold go down then you would be there ready to stand your ground and protect the innocent and needed&quot;</em>, those were the words of his master and future brother on the watchers over the fallen.

He walked until he found another person over there, she looked troubled and he couldn&#39;t ignore someone in need, he had never done so with his brother or when he was serving the watch, and he wouldn&#39;t start now. He came closer to the woman and touched her shoulder softly, &quot;Hello there Miss, I am Bofwant, the onboard doctor to treat emergency wounds and the occasional desease or poinosed case, you seem troubled, is there any way that I can help you?&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">“Oh...!” Sela said with a start. The rich baritone had completely startled the red head, causing her tiny body to jump, her hands moving to grip the rail. Normally, she was the one sneaking up on others, the one no one could see. Typically, she preferred it that way. But now that the Steel Hearts has opened themselves up to her and her brother, she knew she needed to swallow down the paranoia and try and make friends. Besides, she had a curse to break and a hag to avoid. She knew right well that she’d placed herself in danger the moment Barachiel’s transformation had been lifted... if even only temporarily. 

“Hello,” Sela mumbled in return. She tilted her head, golden eyes gazing up into a face she didn’t know, yet one that also seemed familiar. When the man informed her that he  was the onboard doctor, she suddenly remembered why there was that small sense of familiarity. “Doctor? Then you’ve seen Barachiel. My twin...” she went on, trying to read Bofwant’s reactions. “I’m his twin sister, Selaphiel Rookwood. Though, I go by Sela.” Briefly, the girl’s face flushed red, heat sweeping down along her neck making her entire body feel warm. If this man had seen her brother, perhaps he would know how his condition was faring and if he was managing to rest up. “How is he doing?” she then asked. “Is he doing well?” </div>

Bofwant opened his eyes and gesturwd towards one of the benches, &quot;Let&#39;s sit down miss sela, this is a delicate subject&quot; he walked towards it and waited for her so sit down first before he started to explain abut her brother, he could understand her pain.

Regardless, she did as suggested, following the man’s request to the letter. Once seated, her hands reached for the bench’s edge, knuckles going white from her far too tight grip. 

“Delicate how?” Sela asked, trying to mask her fear and worry. “Is he not well? Has there been trouble?” She was having all she could not scream and shout. Yes, she’d found Barachiel... but things were still not quite right. An evil magic hung heavy about her family and it would take time to set things right again. “Please, sir,” she implored. “Please tell me he’s all right.” </div>

Keeping her eyes fixed on the ground, she then nodded, her body visibly shaking. “If it helps...” she started, her thoughts returning to those darkest of days. “Then I’ll tell you everything.”

Never before had Sela spoken the whole truth of her past. Those days had been the stuff of nightmares. Memories she didn’t wish to recall, though they forever haunted her dreams. Taking a deep breath, the girl licked at her lips and sighed deep so as to find her center. 

“I come from a past shrouded in darkness,” Sela began. She hated how it sounded so dramatic. But she was hardly exaggerating and so very far from joking. “My parents were horrible people, so my brother did his best to always protect me. Then, one night, something seemed wrong... even for our household.” The girl raised a hands, her fingers began tugging at a fiery lock. “We found our parents brutally murdered, our mother trying to speak face down in her own blood...” The girl sucked in a sharp breath, desperate to hold onto her composure. </div>

He freed me from that malicious grip, sacrificing himself instead. I... I couldn’t just let him go. But... I wasn’t strong enough or fast enough. I’ll never forget those blue hands. Strong hands that swiped at my face...” Her other hand moved to touch her scars, the first of her tears starting to fall. “I vowed I’d get him back. Find him. And... and I did.”

Sela looked up at Bofwant, tears running freely down her scarred face. She suddenly became aware of how she looked, so she pulled up her hood to try and cover her face, her gaze once again lowered. “I found him just outside of Pioneer,” she added. “He’d been cursed by some hag. A hag that watches. That knows. A hag who will come for me now, along with him. I... I don’t know what to do...” she suddenly mumbled through tears. How she hated herself for becoming so vulnerable in that moment. “But she needs to be stopped. I... just don’t know how or where to start.” </div>

But... a time eventually came when I just didn’t want to know. Where I...” She choked on a sob. “Where I just hope my brother and I could be rid of them forever and just be... safe.” </div>

I don’t know,” she then admitted, very uncertain and now worried that there might be more to her current ordeal than she’d thought. “No one has ever hugged me before. Well, no one besides my twin, that is.” The girl sat up, shaking hands reaching for her hood and pushing it back. Her face was splotchy, her nose red and puffy, her eyes clearly sore from crying. And then there was that scar marring her otherwise pretty face. “I can try it,” she said aloud, thinking to herself. “I... I can.” If Bofwant was right, she hoped it would help the worst of it, just maybe she’d be able to sleep properly for once in her life. “You May give me a hug,” she went on, giving him her consent. </div>

He put his arms around her softly, mindful of his hard armor and hugged her, it was a hug hard enough to bring comfort but loose enough that she could escape if she wanted to, &quot;Miss sela, sometimes the  best way to help others is to help yourself first, I only that you are worried about your brother state but if you as the one that are in a better place can&#39;t stand on your own, how do you plan to help him? I am not telling you that you are in the wrong, only that you need to start to heal before you can help others heal.... Do you want to hear my story?

He seemed to take great care when he pulled her close, letting her know he was there, but in control of her body and the situation. The girl could feel his warmth, the cool hardness of metal, as it touched her soft skin. His arms rested about her, just holding her for several moments. Nothing more. It felt... nice. Safe. 

Sniffling against Bofwant, Sela then nodded. “Please,” she said. “You listened to mine. I’d like to listen to yours.” The girl swallowed, her body starting to relax. Though her worries were still quite present, they suddenly seemed more manageable. Plus, it felt good that another wished to share something personal. Something... them. She’d grown up in a world of fear and darkness, of secrets and shadow. She was... tired. Ready just to live. “So please,” she went on. “Tell me your story.” </div>

 When he was old enough to get a job he suddenly wanted to explore the world, anyone like him would just have gone to the clocktower but he was a visionary, he didn&#39;t want to learn what other knew, no, he only wanted to find inspiration to make &#39;the perfect tool&#39;, so as his older brother I did all what I could to help him achieve his dream, I found work for him in a ship, and that Miss Sela was my mistake, because I was a fool, weak, I was not a visionary like him, all I knew was to take care of him and in my ignorance....&quot; He paused for a second, taking a deep breath, that had been his mistake, and only his mistake, he had accepted it but it was still painful.

&quot;...that day I was recruited by the brotherhood, The watchers over the fallen order, they saw something in me that I had not noticed and when they told me their Creed then I had to join.

Do you want to hear the words Miss Sela?&quot; He asked her softly, they were heavy words, had a need meaning not only for a brother but for any person and he didn&#39;t want to overwhelm her with it. </div>

Indeed, a brother was something she could understand. Barachiel, her twin and other half, had been her world. She hadn’t known life without him and then... then he was ripped away, leaving behind a gaping hole where her heart beat frantically in fear. She snuggled closer to the man, just enough to feel safe and his arms hugged her harder, pulling her close. The girl was grateful for his kindness, his willingness to share and to listen. 

“I’m sorry you lost yours too,” Sela then said, her golden eyes closing for a moment. She’d been fortunate. She’d been reunited with her brother. But... at what price? It was still anyone’s guess. “Do you think you’ll find him? I’ll help. My own brother too. I... I know it! Well, if he’s stable enough he will.” The girl bit down on her lower lip, teeth scraping the plump pink flesh. “I’m unfamiliar with Helm,” she then admitted, cheeks turning red and warm. The girl pulled back a little, her face tilting just slightly, so she could look up and into his. “Yes, please. What were the words?” she then asked, her body shifting so she could still feel his warmth. His unspoken promise of safety and security. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Bofwant took another deep breath and with a solemn voice recited his Creed, it was so important to him because before knowing it he was already living by it, they said that he as a watcher, favored by helm to be a protector, that&#39;s how they convinced him to join them and he didn&#39;t regret it until he found that his brother was lost...

<em>&quot;Never betray your trust. Be vigilant. Stand, wait,and watch carefully. Be fair and diligent in the conduct of your orders. Protect the weak, poor, injured, and young, and do not sacrifice them for others or yourself. Anticipate attacks and be ready. Know your foes. Care for your weapons so they may perform their duties when called upon. Careful planning always defeats rushed actions in the end. Always obey orders, providing those orders follow the dictates of Helm. Demonstrate excellence and purity of loyalty in your role as a guardian and protector.&quot;</em>

She could feel how the air around her was filled with safety and comfort when he recited those words, words that he lived by since he could remember.

&quot;I went with them, learned to fight, to heal and to protect, I became a Frontline healer, saving lives from the brink of death in the middle of the battlefield was my calling, my path.... Until I found that my brother was lost, his ship missing the only clue was his armband that was found by some fishermen.... But I know that he&#39;s alive because of he wasn&#39;t then I would be a liar, a failure, this blessings would be nothing...&quot; </div>

It only served to keep Sela more at ease, while she continued to try and let her body relax. While the tone of his voice aided in calming the worst of her anxiety, the words he spoke did even more. They were profound in their meaning, their promise. And though she knew he was merely reciting something, it was easy enough to believe that he meant them just for her in that moment of need. 

Her head resting against his chest, fiery tresses against metal, Sela just savored the moment. But then, she heard it. The way the pitch of Bofwant’s deep voice suddenly changed. He was upset. Sad. Frustrated. The girl could tell something burned his soul. And then he told her how his brother was lost, presumed dead. He felt guilty, like it had been his fault. She knew it wasn’t, though she understood why he thought as much. It had been similar for her. She couldn’t have predicted Barachiel’s actions just like Bofwant couldn’t predict what might happen to a ship. 

“I... I believe he’s out there,” Sela suddenly found herself muttering. She moved slightly in Bofwant’s arms, looking up into his face. The elf dared to smile, her eyes shining with tears not yet spilled. “You’ll find him. I know you will. Just like I found Barachiel.” Suddenly, on instinct, she gave him a hug of her own. One meant for him so that he too might feel some comfort. </div>

So he just waited there, patiently waiting for her to break the gesture that despite being small and insignificant in the great scheme of things, was the first step to heal. He was grateful for this unusual encounter where he had found someone like him, willing not only to give everything for a lover one, but despite their burdens, they still had words of comfort for another one. </div>

The kiss of cold air swirled about them both, her fiery hair lightly blowing, forming a sort of halo about her scarred, yet otherwise pretty, face. 

“You’re welcome, you’ve helped me so much these past few moments. And... I meant what I said.” Sela licked at her lips. “I’ll help you find your brother. So will Barachiel, though... might it not be too forward of me to request your aid when my brother and I search for the one after us both?” She looked away then. “I ask too much. Forgive me.”

Sela pulled away and raked a hand through her hair. “I didn’t mean to ask that of you. I’m sorry... do know my brother and I are at your service. I promise this.” The girl placed her delicate hand on Bofwant’s arm and gave him a gentle squeeze. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Sela’s eyes immediately were drawn to Bofwant placing his hand over hers. He was warm and strong and... kind. She knew so little of that. The only kindness she’d ever known was from her brother. Her mother’s cruel words still rang in her ears at night. And her father... the sting of his fists and the feel of his palms sliding along her body. It was enough to make her want to vomit sometimes. But Barachiel had always made it better. He’d distract their parents, making himself their target instead. She’d felt a ripple of freedom when she saw their dead bodies... only to be thrown into darkness once more when her brother was taken and she was scarred. 

Just then, in that moment, Sela felt lucky. Lucky to have her brother back at all and lucky to have met this man sitting across from her. She slid her gaze back up to his face and smiled. “You are so kind, Bofwant. Thank you... I... I don’t deserve this. Just... thank you.” Unable to help it, she started crying again. Tears of humility and gratitude. She then gave him a nod, while sniffing softly. “Something better... my brother,” she said easily, not a shred of hesitation. “My brother was the light. Always there and trying to protect. He always did his best. Always.” </div>

For now let&#39;s focus on something else, what about your education? Did you have any sort of pr&#237;vate tutoring? Or did you go to a public school?&quot; He had never received a formal education, he learned geography as he traveled with the watchers, math and letters as he struggled to make his reports and read his orders, ettiquette when he had become an officer and fighting in the middle of the bloody battlefield. He was not sure but anything could give them a cluy where to start searching for her enemies.

Bofwant nodded after noticing her tears and reached with his hand to clean them from her cheeks, just like he used to do with his little brother or with recently rescued children in the frontlines.  He paused mid way and asked her for permission, &quot;May I?&quot; </div>

The girl looked up at him and just nodded. “You may.” Her cheeks went red, wishing she could hide those terrible scars marring her face. Throughout the years, they’d served as a reminder of that dark and terrible night Barachiel had been taken away. 

And then she remembered... the dancing. She hadn’t been the best of performers, but she’d loved learning. Oftentimes, her brother would watch, providing her that encouragement she needed to hear. He’d always been her biggest supporter and fan. “There was dancing,” she then said. “I always found peace when I danced.” She lowered her gaze for a moment. “Silly, I know, but... I could be anything when I danced.” </div>

He heard her talk about dancing, interesting, maybe she had some teachers or her own mother taught her? He was not the best at this but he would still try to help her, &quot;Miss sela that is good, now, can you tell me more about your dancing? Where did you learn? And maybe if you had some teachers or public performances.... Maybe a party that you remember when you danced?&quot; They needed to study every angle because the clues could be hidding in plain sight.

Bofwant stood from the bench and turned towards the elf, &quot;Miss Sela, would you like to go with me to get some to eat? Maybe a dessert? I have found that our brains work better when we don&#39;t focus on the problem too hard, because then we start to only see the same issues over and over again, and the answer was just laying in front of our noses, so a small break could be helpful for us.&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Sela shifted on the bench, her golden eyes watching Bofwant stand up and step to be in front of her. She nodded slowly, biting down on her lip for a moment. “I had teachers,” she said. “My parents had said it was tradition within the House. So, I was schooled in dance, while my brother was schooled in swordplay. A different type of dance, as he used to say.” The girl paused a moment, the smallest of smiles tugging at her lips. “The arts and other such fine customs were especially important within the House.” 

Though Sela’s parents had never divulged details, they’d been sure to make it clear that there were certain things that had to be followed. At times, she’d wanted to press, curious to know and to understand. But she learned early on not to cross her parents. It had almost always ended badly. She could recall the time her father had watched her practicing. The man had cornered her, had forced her to put herself on display for him. But Barachiel had managed to put a stop to it, allowing dance to remain her one means of finding peace. 

“Ohh...” Sela’s smile broadened. “Dessert... dessert would be lovely.” Her face reddened and she stood up, a foot shorter than the large man standing next to her. “Do you like strawberries, Bofwant?” she then asked. Just a simple question, showing her desire to get to know the kind man who offered her his company and aid. </div>

The sound of metal scraping against metal came up the stairs as a big man.  A huge man in plate was carrying two barrels.  

He was heaving, panting.  It was too much weight for the man.  His head hung low as he attempted to keep himself up, on balance, long brown hair draped over his face, soaked in sweat.

He tettered on one side and then ended up dropping one of the barrels with a slam, nearly cracking it.  He leaned over it... seemingly unnoticing of the two others on the top deck. </div>

Bofwant was about to ask Sela to follow him to the mess Hall when he heard the commotion, he turned around quickly, his body getting ready to defend his new charge but he only saw an exhausted man leaning over a barrel, &quot;Excuse me for a second Miss Sela...&quot; He said quickly to her and walked towards the man.

Bofwant quickly took the other barrel from his arms, letting the man rest for a second, &quot;Good day, I am Bofwant, the on board healer in charge of emergencies, do you need help with this?&quot; He said to the man trying to sound friendly, he knew that his rough army accent coul put people in the defensive, so since he joined the guild he had been working to be more friendly and approachable. </div>

She was about to say as much when their conversation was interrupted by a very loud thud. She stood behind Bofwant, peering around his large form, as he placed himself in a position to defend and protect her, if needed. Her cheeks grew hot, she dared a step closer to see who was there. 

“I’m Sela,” Sela said softly. “Well, Selaphiel Rookwood d’Phiarlan.” She giggled softly. Her parents had always forbidden she and Barachiel to use their titles. So it felt like a little victory to say it out loud—d’Phiarlan. </div>

After that small introduction Bofwant looked at sela, he had invited her to eat some desserts but now they had a new friend that may need their help, &quot;Just as I told you Miss Sela, sometimes unexpected encounters like these happen and you need to always be ready to offer your help, not only because it&#39;s what Helm stands for, but because in the process you make new friends that will help you in turn...&quot; Bofwant looks at the glowing man, &quot;...

She looked to him and then Bofwant and then giggled when the winged man said her title incorrectly. “d’Phiarlan...” she said again, though a little more slowly. The girl then watched the two men converse for a bit, the exchange rather amiable and light. Despite her earlier tears, she was feeling so very much better. It was as if a weight had suddenly lifted, though a part of her feared its inevitable return. The elf nodded then, agreeing that Bofwant was in fact right. “Yes, and... If... if I might be able to help,” she offered. “I will do my best.” She looked up at Bofwant for reassurance before biting down on her lip, her cheeks red, her gaze now lowered. </div>

So, the girl just watched as Baresque set everything up and spoke of things she did not know or understand. When the winged man bid her to approach him, she immediately looked to Bofwant for guidance. In the world she knew, it was hard to trust anyone and the large man had gained hers. If he thought it all right for her to move closer and peek at the strange gadgets attached to the weapon, then she’d proceed knowing it was safe. Though despite some apprehensions, she was glad to not have her offer of help dismissed. It was nice knowing others thought her aid could be worth something. </div>

&quot;Anticipate attacks and be ready. Know your foes. Care for your weapons so they may perform their duties when called upon....&quot; He recited solemnly and then turned towards Sela.

&quot;It is ok miss Sela, this coul become vital in the future, not only are we testing the weapons but teaching you how to properly use them. Men such as ourselves are well handled in the war machinery but we can&#39;t be everywhere in a moment of need, is up to everyone collaborate to reach a common goal so please, try it, and don&#39;t be afraid, I won&#39;t let you get hurt and I&#39;m sure if my fellow brother in arms is asking you then it&#39;s completely safe for you to use it.&quot; He said to her, encouraging her to try it and follow the angelic man&#39;s instructions. &quot;Isn&#39;t that right Master Baresque?&quot; </div>

Slowly, the girl moved from behind Bofwant and stepped forward until she was right next to the cannon, Baresque wished to show her. Her golden eyes scanned the thing, noting all the little gadgets that made it operate. She was especially intrigued by the spyglass. Her parents had such devices before they’d passed, though she’d never had desire to hold onto anything that had been theirs. “I’ll learn then,” she said, echoing Bofwant’s sentiments. For some reason, she wanted him to be proud of her—her choices and actions, how quick she could learn. As Sela tested things, she looked back to the large man, hoping he was pleased with how well she was doing. “So are these needed as Bofwant has mentioned?” she then asked. </div>

We need to test the potentcy of these weapons!  If they cannot handle the wall that is my bulwark, these devices are hardly worth the scrap they are made of!&quot;  He emphasized certain words, it was how he talked it seemed.  Big and boisterous.

&quot;Bofwant, you might also like to take notes.  There is nothing quite like feeling the quake of a cannons blast!  Knowing full well that retribution and righteousness is inflicted with a blast of black powder and iron shrapnel.  Now Lady Sela, look here...&quot;  

He pulled the lever, a 20 or so pound cannon ball is loaded into the back end of the breech.  He pushes the lever back which locks it in.  &quot;Now there, here&#39;s the fun part.  This weapon doesn&#39;t fire something so crude as iron...&quot;  he moved the joystick, this caused the wheels to turn, the end to cant up and down, aiming itself.  &quot;Here, aim it into the darkness...  That button there, fires... If its as I was told, this weapon is meant to bring the storm, the THUNDERCLAP!

Once again, she looked back at Bofwant and gave him a smile before she moved to approach the now loaded cannon. Carefully, she inspected the thing, wanting to understand how it was loaded, how it worked. Having never seen such a device, her curiosity was somewhat piqued. Once satisfied, her golden gaze slid to that button. Again, she looked back at Bofwant and then slowly brought her hand closer to that tempting button. Did it really call forth the storm? She supposed there was only one way to know and since Bofwant had already reassured her... and at that Sela made sure the cannon aimed away and then pressed the button that would make the thing fire. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="06-Dec-19 06:45 AM">(edited)</span></div>

Bofwant noticed her looking at him and stepped forward, enough so his presence would reassure her, &quot;You are doing great Miss Sela, don&#39;t be afraid, if something were to go wrong I have the power to heal, it&#39;s limited but I have learned how to use to save people from the brink of dead or prevent a limb from becoming lost, even to heal sickness.

She’d spent the last several years hunting giants and demons, all in the name of finding her brother. The girl had thought them all to be brainless abhorrent creatures... and then she met Wimpy and Dodo. Though the pair was rough around the edges, neither had meant to actually harm another. They had merely wanted to live. It had been an eye opening experience. And her past was riddled with such darkness, that she wasn’t certain she longed to actually seek it out, as she had when desperately trying to find Barachiel. Though, now that he was found... she could start putting such things behind her... if only that hag wasn’t still out there. Watching. Plotting. Planning. 

The girl shivered, her face going pale. Sela looked back at Bofwant again. She needed to know if it was sane to target Baresque. It seemed wrong. Inhumane. She wasn’t sure she could do it. Not this time. “Bofwant?” she then prodded, her voice soft and unsure, her hands beginning to shake. </div>

When he heard the angel&#39;s words he scowled, he was a doctor and he could bring people back from the brink of death but he would never abuse his powers for a stupid experiment like that, shooting that weapon at the man would be tempting fate and he would not participate in such idiocy.

He heard Sela calling for him and he turned to look at her. He noticed that she was shivering with her face going pale and he grew concerned, &quot;Is everything alright? Are you hurt?&quot; </div>

&quot;<em>Demonstrate excellence and purity of loyalty in your role as a guardian and protector.</em>&quot; He recited the final words of his creed, &quot; this is what you just did, you would never harm a friend and I am proud.&quot;

The name to her hunters was known.  The Guild had begun to make preparations for them to defend themselves, and strike out again her attackers.  It was a strange scene, like preparing for a battle against a foe you never wanted to face.  Parcival was hopeful, but he only had Rose&#39;s information.  

The deed was done, and Edgar offered to take her somewhere, and what better then the fresh air at 4000 feet above Erie.  Edgar walked her out, wanting to see that she atleast ended the day with a good thought, a good image.  It was dusk, the vastness of the world bathed in Twilight.

&quot;That was very brave.&quot;  He told her as they stepped onto the deck. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Rose leaned against Edgar, while they stood next to the rail and peered out at the scenery below. The sky was darkening, streaked with soft oranges and purples. She could see the first twinkling dots of stars, as they tried to shine in the wide open sky. There was a chill in the air, the wind stronger up above, swirling about their bodies while they remained fixed to their spots. Her dress billowed, the silky material pulling at her body, giving the ranger a view he could appreciate if he so desired. Goosebumps formed along her flesh, turning a pale rosy shade, as she blushed before him. 

“Really?” Rose asked aloud. Her icy eyes peered up into Edgar’s face. Without realizing it, she pressed closer to him, letting their bodies find their way to fit together. It was amazing how well they did, his warmth so inviting and a comfort. “I worry I’ve put you all in needless danger. This Flock sounds rather dangerous.” She paused, the wind whipping at her wild white curls. “Do you really think we can best them at their own game and stop them for good?” Oh she hoped so. But she needed to hear this man say it. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Edgar was to offer her his coat against the wind, but instead she turned to him, pressing herself, his shoulder just at her height for her to lay her head upon it in comfort.&#160; His hands went around her back, even cradling her head against him, bracing her to him. He tried not to think of the touch of her dress, how it seemed to grip and bind itself around her frame.&#160; So thin he could feel her skin prickle underneath. He would not keep her out here long, how biting it gets after sundown.
“I know.”&#160; He told her.&#160; “There is no easy way to do this.&#160; But remember... this is their fault.&#160; Not yours. You never asked for this.”&#160; It was true, and it was often the victim who blames themselves the evil of others.&#160; It was easy to blame yourself when you are met with fear and anger from those who abandon you in greatest need.&#160; His grip on her became a little tighter. 

He looked her in the eyes when she asked.&#160; His hand moving to keep the hair out of her eyes, her face.&#160; He smiled, orange eyes like some parts of the dusking sky. He couldn’t help himself.&#160; He closed his eyes, and kissed her, slowly, meaningfully before he pulled back a little, to trace her vibrant face like winter.&#160; “We are. Together. We’re doing this for you, and everyone they ever, will ever hurt. We’re going to win.” He then bit his lip a little while his cheeks crimsoned.&#160;&#160;
“I know it’s a lot to ask right now.&#160; But, I’d like to see you smile again.”

It was pleasant and strong, so curious yet wonderful. When he pulled away, she felt slightly dazed, her breaths ragged and short, as she tried her best to focus. The eladrin looked up into his eyes—the color of sunset, so captivating, beckoning. She could feel the tips of his fingers tracing her face, her hairline. The girl was trembling in his arms, her own moving to hold onto him, not wanting to let go. 

“Together,” Rose managed to whisper, though barely. Her body was feeling things she’d never felt before, had no idea existed. Feelings she found herself liking. “You make me smile, Edgar,” she then admitted, a pretty blush sweeping across her cheeks and finding its way along the swells of her breasts. “When I’m with you, everything just seems... better.” The girl tightened her hold, her body pressing against his. Once more, she was lost. And she was happy to be lost in this man. In Edgar Clay. </div>

She smiled at him and he responded with a little chuckle, “Good, cause I’m really trying.”&#160; his closed eyes as his foreheard was tickled by her light hair. They looked like a young couple in love, before the world wanted to stamp out everything beautiful and pure.&#160; Serene and peaceful. He only had one regret. “I need to hold you again when I get out of this armor. Sorry about that, hope its not hurting you.” He wouldn’t be the most comfortable man to lean on but he was hers, and that counted for alot.&#160;&#160;
He still had a little worry.&#160; Her shaking for instance. At first he considered it less the palpitations of her heart and more the wind.&#160; Yes body heat was a wonderful thing, but sometimes you just didn’t have enough covering, and the fact he brought her up here with was essentially a silk sheet and nothing else.&#160; He felt stupid... and maybe something else. They way she pushed up against him caused her features to be more noticable. “Rose, youre shaking.” Hed offer her something but all he had was armor.&#160; “We’ll come back out here tonight. When you have a cloak on.”
He didn’t want to leave her.&#160; Not ever, and especially not that night, but they ate already and all he wanted to do was hold her.&#160; He took a deep breath, Edgar didn’t want to appear anything less than her prince, the one who made things better.&#160; “Let head to your room. Warm up a little.” He suggested, his arm would be over her shoulder and grip her hand, the other doing the same, so it looked like he would be hiding her as they walked.&#160; 

“There’s a couple things I want to tell you.”&#160; He hinted, perhaps playfully. </div>

For a moment, she’d almost forgotten how cold the frosty night air had become. But it was easy being so close to this man, in his arms. Held close. 

“My room isn’t far,” Rose then said, her lips curving up into a shy smile. But, Edgar was right. It would be good to warm up a little, to go inside and continue enjoying the moment in warmth and comfort. “It even has a fireplace.” Not removing herself from his hold, she moved towards the stairs that would lead them both back inside.

She could forget all the horror she’d played a part in, not realizing what she’d been enabling at all. 

Again, Hal felt her blue eyes begin to sting. With a soft sniffle, she wiped away the tears and quickly regained her composure. The girl sighed softly then, clearing her head and just allowing the quiet moment to be enjoyed for once. </div>

As the blast of fresh air hit her senses, the girl just smiled and happily stretched her arms. She made soft little sounds of approval, loving how sweet the air seemed to taste. The view wasn’t bad either, little houses dotting the countryside in small interspersed clumps. It was quaint and perfect. Just what she’d needed after everything she’d recently endured. 

Finding a seat on one of the benches, Hal pulled her wild red hair back into a sloppy knot. Several stray tendrils still seemed to blow in the wind against her pale face. Though, she hardly minded. Bringing her flute up to her lips, she began playing a haunting melody. Soft and pleasant. It was an older tune quite well known in the Feywild—the home that was no longer her own, the one also ravaged with war. 

Hal closed her bright blue eyes, just letting the music envelope her, while she played. Yes, she was one with this music she made. Lost in its ethereal sound, and finding some semblance of inner peace. At least for the time being anyway. </div>

His need for both notoriety and fame. Despite his seemingly disagreeable demeanor, something kept tugging at her to find out more. It was clear enough that he’d been wronged at one point, something that had changed his life forever. Could that be set right? Did he even want it to be? So many questions. And she’d find her answers. Eventually...

Just then, a cool breeze blew a few stray tendrils into her face. Hal’s eyes opened, bright blue. Intense. And she pulled her pan pipe away from her lips. With a soft giggle, she pushed the hair out of her face and turned slightly, suddenly, noticing another had found his way up above. He seemed agitated somehow and he most certainly was a face she didn’t know. 

“Can I help you?” Hal asked, her eyes darting to the large piece of paper he was holding... and seemingly fighting with. </div>

She darted down them, her steps light and graceful, as she moved. Pan flute clutched tightly in her hand, she decided her time would be better spent in her room.

This upper deck appears to have solved both issues in allowing him to stretch his legs and allow the wonderful good boi to bark away at each passing bird that dare stray close. 

So there was Kor, having taken a seat as the movement up there wasn&#39;t exactly to his liking and he wished to stay grounded, and a little ways away from him was Warrez, running back and forth barking happily at anything with feathers and wings. At least it was peaceful up here. </div>

Being a hunter, he had no reason to deny the man; it was prudent for one to be as well versed in as many weapons as possible. As it was, he would upon the top deck, having borrowed two simple longbows from Nash, as well two quivers of arrows. He knew how to use and maintain them, but if the lesson was how to build them? He could not help him. 

The breeze on the top deck reminded him of his mountain home; he should come up here more often. It was so peaceful atop this ship; Uthal had set up two simple targets such that the wind from the draft over the surface of the ship would not affect their flight all that much. After all, this but lesson one.

While he waited though, he would be practicing shooting the high-flying birds; arrow after arrow found its mark, the birds falling back down as he would yank a string attached to the projectile. The very least he could do was gather some meat if he was going to be bidding time; wasting prey would dishonor his pride as a hunter after all. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="21-Jul-20 10:28 PM">(edited)</span></div>

He had gotten the inspiration from his mate, even if she mostly used her powerful voice, she still had some ranged weapons just in case.

After going to buy one longbow big enough for a goliath, Mors had seen the offer posted for teaching how to use weapons from the hunter so he had sent a minion with a message arranging some classes.

That&#39;s how the overlord found himself on the top deck. Heavy armored steps announced his arrival but he remained silent, just watching how the hunter took down those birds from the sky.
No minions followed him today since he had chosen to keep these classes as a small surprise for his mate, so he had left to take race of her and let him know if anything happened.

&quot;Hunter...&quot; Mors finally greeted Uthal with his eachoing voice. &quot;Very impressive.&quot; He gestured towards the pile of dead birds. </div>

The overlord thought for a second but he couldn&#39;t remember if he ever had handled any kind of ranged weapons. It was annoying sometimes, those missing pieces of his memory. &quot;No. I do not recall ever using ranged weapons... Only using my powers to fire blasts from my warhammer.&quot; Mors finally answered, easily raising his hammer and showing the hunter what he could do. He gathered his power, pieces of the hammer begging to glow in that evil green of his before he shot a blast to the sky, not aiming at anything in particular.

Then he let go of his power, the hammer returning not normal before he lowered it down to the floor since he already knew he would need both hands to use the bow. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Uthal seemed impressed by the display; he himself could not use magic, nor did he understand anything about it. Even so, he had a feeling the Goliath was a quick learner; he imagined magic took many years to master.

&quot;I see. We shall start from the basics then.&quot; Uthal would say, taking an arrow from the quiver standing near them. He would then hold it up, &quot;This is an arrow, your primary ammunition. Before you prepare to use them, it is best to inspect your arrows for any defects, as it could potentially affect your accuracy.&quot; He would point at a slot on the back end, &quot;This is the nock, it is where you slide the string into.&quot; He would then point to three feathers just above it, &quot;These are the fletchings. They aid in making sure your shot flies true.&quot;

Tracing his finger along the length, he then said, &quot;This is the shaft of the arrow, and finally of course, is the arrowhead or tip. The tip, much like a blade, should be sharp but not brittle-edged. There are many kinds of arrow heads, but they largely serve one purpose: Clean, precision killshots. And best part is, they can be retrieved like javelins.&quot; Truth be told, there were arrowheads that were blunted to stun instead of kill, but that would be for another time.  

Uthal had noted the Goliath brought his own bow, but this would actually help him; he had a lower draw weight bow, to help illustrate the difference. &quot;Now...When choosing a bow, be sure you have the right kind of arrows. Lighter arrows for bows that don&#39;t require much force to draw the string, heavier arrows for bows that require more. We will go into that a bit later.&quot;

He would then grab his bow, the draw weight more than appropriate for someone of his build. &quot;To nock an arrow, place an arrow across the middle of the bow with the bowstring in the arrow&#39;s nock. Then raise...&quot; Mors would see Uthal raise the bow in front of him, &quot;Draw the string, make adjustments to aim....&quot; The string pulled back, he bow creaking a bit as he then said, &quot;And release.&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">However, instead of firing, he would allow the string to relax while making sure the arrow didn&#39;t fly out, unnocking the arrow, &quot;For now, we shall practice form; to fire a bow requires a hint of subtlety. You must not force a bow; a bow will work with you if you work with it.&quot;

He would then motion to the other Goliath to pick up his bow, &quot;Now, do as I have just done, but do not release the string until I say. I intend to see what I have to work with, in case you are wondering why I am asking this of you.&quot; </div>

The dark overlord picked up an arrow and studied it, noticing everything that the other man had pointed before. &quot;Very well Hunter. I shall do as you ask.&quot; Following the instructions he picked up his longbow and did as requested, his great strength allowing so easily pull the string and hold it there for the hunter to inspect the things he needed.

&quot;This is... Interesting.&quot; Mors commented, his evil voice eachoing around them, as he tried to aim properly while he waited for further instructions. </div>

Use only two fingers for a straight pull; four causes the string to be overly tight and can affect accuracy.&quot; He then lifted the elbow that  was jutting up behind a bit, &quot;When you draw the string, try to draw on the same level as the arm holding your bow. This will ensure the arrow is inline with the crook of your bow, and not cocked up or down.&quot; 

He would then say, noticing something else; &quot;You nearly have the right distance, but it&#39;s seems you&#39;re a bit overdrawn. Try bringing the fingers on the string closer to your chin; it&#39;s hard to explain, but the string should feel...Tight but not strained, and the bow should only give moderate pressure in your palm.&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Even if he was not one to let other close to him unless it was his mate... and maybe the minions, the overlord knew that some things were better shown with actions, specially ones about warfare. So after a few seconds Mors looked at the other Giant and just nodded, giving him permission to do as he wanted.

The overlord listened and let himself be corrected, doing as best as he could so he was doing thing properly. &quot;I see. Let the weapon do as it needs. Do not force it.&quot; He grumbled mostly to himself. It was obvious that Mors lacked the certain dexterity needed to naturally wield a weapon like this one but that would not stop him from learning. After all one could never stop growing stronger and he was doing this as a gift for his family, not for himself.

&quot;For one that is so wild in the battlefield, you really know how to handle the more finer weapons. I am impressed Hunter... Is this better?&quot; He finally asked after following Uthal&#39;s instructions. Good thing that he had left his heavy armor and gauntlets in his room, only his helmet and boots were the armored pieces he was wearing right now, otherwise he knew it would have been harder for him to draw the bow properly. He already could feel that this was better than how he had been holding the ranged weapon but still he was a patient student and would only release the arrow when ordered, for one such as him it was not straining at all to hold this position. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Yes, the magic-aligned giantkin was understanding; good. Though truth be told Uthal would also understand him being impatient; bows were not his favorite weapon to use, but to be a hunter one had to adept and able to use weapons to take out certain prey. Which meant at least a familiarity with everything; though of course, being a Goliath, he had no choice to be try and use them all masterfully. Shields, swords, even daggers and flails; they all had their niche applications.

&quot;It was not an easy process to learn this weapon, though I appreciate your compliment. But yes, much better...Now allow your string to relax, but do not fire your arrow, and allow your bow to rest in front of you. For the large part of today, we shall practice form and technique; though with how you managed to adapt so fluidly I doubt this will be needed more than once.&quot; he would say, waiting for the goliath to relax the string and lower Now, raise the down to in front of you....And draw again, just like before, but do not fire.&quot; Uthal said, watching Mors as he might repeat the action.

Making some corrections, Uthal would say, &quot;Again...&quot; Over and over he would have Mors relax the string and lower the bow, helping him develop the muscle memory to ensure a consistent draw every time, as well as simulate what it was like to have to fire a bow multiple times in a row. After what was probably the thirtieth time of him repeating the action, he would then say, &quot;Excellent...Your form is getter better.&quot; 

&quot;Now....Draw your arrow....&quot; Uthal commanded, and then said what any archer would love to hear, &quot;And fire.&quot; </div>

With every draw and release he could feel what Uthal was trying to teach him. &quot;It is not an easy weapon, yes...&quot; Mors regonized as he repeated the actions over and over again. &quot;But very useful and deadly...&quot; The overlord commented, all his focus on trying bro memorize the proper way to draw the bow.

He was not one to easily share his thoughts but after having fought together there was a sort of camaraderie between the giants, besides this could help in recruiting the hunter for his army in the future. &quot;I am doing this... So I can have the honor to teach my own younglings. My mate knows the smaller version of this weapon but she has yet to master this bigger one... It is a gift for her too.&quot; He confessed as he pulled and released again and again.

Then he finally heard the command to actually fire and Mora released the arrow almost instinctively since something about this class was very familiar to him, perhaps it made him remember when he was a youngling himself as was learning under his parents, yet the actual memory was still lost to him.

The arrow flew true and embedded itself on the target. It was not a perfect shot but yet it was a very good one. &quot;Impressive... Perhaps next time I shall bring my mate too, so she can learn from someone so good at this.&quot; The overlord said, giving the credit of this small success to the other Goliath. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Uthal had heard the comment, but did not reply so as not to break the Goliath&#39;s focus; it was a noble goal, to be able to pass the knowledge to your children was something that was very common among the tribal Goliath race, and something they especially took pride in. And to that end, Uthal would make sure Mors had the same level of proficiency as himself. 

The string gave that satisfying twang as it was loosed, the thread carrying the projectile forward and making it fly downrange. Before long the arrow came to rest in the target; not the best shot in the world, but for someone who claimed to have no memorable experience, that was very good. 

&quot;Yes, bring her; I would be happy to share this knowledge with her as well. But I think that will do it for today; next time, we shall continue to refine form and begin working on accuracy.&quot; Uthal would say, giving the goliath a nod and adding &quot;You did very well, for someone who said they couldn&#39;t remember using this sort of weapon. Perhaps this training will unlock those memories from within. In any event, well done, Mors.&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Mors nodded after hearing Uthal&#39;s words. &quot;No matter the case I shall work to improve in this weapon.&quot; The overlord said before he picked another arrow. Once again took aim and fired. This time he had used too much force, so instead of hitting the target the arrow just flew off the ship, becoming lost in the sky.

Mors frowned but decided that this was normal, he knew that failure was part of the learning process. &quot;There is still a long way for me to master this weapon. I shall practice as much as I can.&quot; He finally lowered his weapon and looked at the other Goliath. &quot;I have no doubt my mate shall enjoy learning more about it as well.&quot;

Mors closed his eyes and took a moment to enjoy the overall atmosphere of the top deck. The cold wind of such heights was specially appreciated, so different from the inside or his own kingdom. &quot;Tell me Hunter, why learning such weapons if you enjoy the rush of being in the middle of battle?&quot; He asked the other Goliath. Mors himself knew that there were ways to hunt any beast just by using ones physical might and fighting in close range, after all that is what he had done when he lost his memories in the jungle. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Uthal merely watched as Mors fired a second shot, the arrow lost from the force of the pull; giving a small chuckle, he just said, &quot;Well, I feel badly for anyone who might be on the receiving end of that. It&#39;s going with the wind as well.&quot; He didn&#39;t mind; he would just have to pay for the lost arrow. 

However, that went away from his mind as Mors asked him about his desire to learn other weapons. He pondered Mors&#39; question; he hadn&#39;t really thought about it. Among the Katho-Olavi, there was tradition and it was followed. &quot;I suppose it was tradition. Yes, there is no greater thrill in being able to face your enemy head-on and emerge victorious. It sings loudly of your triumph to know there was no tricks or deception involved.&quot; Taking a slight pause, he crossed his massive arms and added, &quot;But, among my clan the Katho-Olavi, we respected the art and purpose of the hunt. Our brothers and sisters of stone would challenge each other and themselves. Who could kill their prey the cleanest, who could kill the fastest. We knew to not make our prey suffer unduly, for in the taking of their life we would continue our own. And t that end, I took it as a challenge to learn every weapon, even the more delicate ones.&quot;

Taking a pause, he then said, &quot;On the battlefield, it is different, that is one thing I&#39;ve learned. Neither side is predator in that situation, and neither side is prey. In war, it is purely meant to test your will to live. And as such, we must fight to live, to carry on our ways...And the only way to do that, is to strike first. Strike first and strike hard. Only then will you learn if it is truly your time to leave this mortal plane or not.&quot; </div>

Mors picked up his warhammer, letting letting the heavy weapon rest over his shoulder. &quot;These traditions seem to be common among giants... I do not remember the fools that raised me, yet I met some of them not long ago.&quot; It took a real man to talk about their failures but Mors knew that this hunter would understand. Unknowingly his words changed from common to giant. <span class="spoiler spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"><span class="spoiler-text">&quot; The fool that calls himself my father challenged me...

I lost, yet death couldn&#39;t claim me, I came back but I was lost. Only my fierce mate could bring me back by conquering my new kingdom and then myself.&quot;</span></span>

It would be certainly worthy of a challenge; but Uthal was cognizant of his limits.

Footsteps, light but quick as a woman with pale skin and a beaming expression gasped upon finally having made her way to the top deck. The sight alone left her giddy and eagerly she had headed over to one of the many railings along the side to peer over it and out at the endless expanse of sky before her. 

Neither of the two present had met this one, she certainly left enough of an impression that much was certain, so surely she was a new hire here amidst the guild. Strange like all the other hires, but again strange in her own unique ways, that porcelain like skin certainly one obvious feature that stood out amidst the many she showed so casually. She practically radiated this aura of sorts, the kind that screamed of optimism and kind words in abundance, like an eager teacher overlooking students or a proud mother. 

For now she had failed to notice the other two and merely continued her gazing, enamored with the sky and sights below. If she was anymore giddy she may very well have tried to get a further look bug as it stands she was smart enough to know not to rely fully upon the strength of the railing lest it break and send her back to earth. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Mors remained silent as Uthal gave him his answer. It was in that moment that Mors knew he had chosen well and decided that he would give the other giant time to decide. <span class="spoiler spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"><span class="spoiler-text">&quot;I know you are not a man of tactics. I have seen it. Yet do not sell yourself short, I have seen your potential.&quot;</span></span>

Mors turned around to look at the sky again, closing his eyes and letting himself just enjoy the coldness. <span class="spoiler spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"><span class="spoiler-text">&quot;Very well.&quot;</span></span> He answered after a few moments.  <span class="spoiler spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"><span class="spoiler-text">&quot;I shall give you the time you desire to make a choice. Even if you refuse to take a leader role, having you in my army as a warrior will increase it&#39;s might by great ammounts. I am certain that my mate shall be happy either way...&quot;</span></span> Mors stopped speaking when he heard someone approaching, he hadn&#39;t noticed that he was speaking in giant and he didn&#39;t want anyone to eveasdrop this particular conversation. 

He opened his glowing eyes and looked around noticing the woman. She had a similar aura as his mate which was interesting yet she looked completely different. &quot;Interesting...&quot; He grumbled, his voice eachoing like always thanks to his evil powers. &quot;Is this another student of yours, hunter?&quot; The overlord asked, loud enough that both Uthal and Celia would be able to hear easily. </div>

I do not believe we have even met yet.&quot; Her stark white skin was a definite eye-catcher, as were the patterns and her blue hair. 

Excusing himself with a bow of his head, he then went to go stand next to the newcomer; though he doubted he could say much from being experienced himself, as he was still a fresh-faced recruit himself. &quot;Excuse me...I do not believe we&#39;ve met yet. Are you new to the Steel Hearts as well?&quot; he would then ask the new woman; he didn&#39;t recognize her race though, and never saw anyone quite like her. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Quickly she was snapped away from her focus upon the endless sky and gave a wide welcoming smile to Uthal. She had the sort of expression that screamed of friendliness and not utter psychopathy. Well at least for now, hopefully that wouldn&#39;t change. Regardless before Uthal had much chance to protest or even react properly would he find the odd woman&#39;s arms thrown right around him in a fairly tight hug. 

&quot;Why hello there! It&#39;s excellent to meet you!&quot; Her voice was soft, airy, like birdsong or a flute. She didn&#39;t feel cold as her skin would have suggested, still felt like flesh even despite the porcelain appearance. The hug was short lived though as she soon pulled away, still smiling. &quot;I was just let aboard quite recently, I am Celia, but if you&#39;d like you may also call me Sister Kindness.&quot; Seeing that smile again it made sense she had gained such a name. </div>

It wasn&#39;t bad, but the hug was just...sudden. Her body did feel quite nice, and when she spoke? He had to wonder if she was part celestial; she seemed...ethereal in a way. His eyes mets with hers, seeing the kindness in her expression as she named her. &quot;Sister Kindness...Indeed, a fitting name. I am Uthal Lonehunter Katho-Olavi, but most call me either Lonehunter or simply &#39;Uthal&#39;. I too am relatively new to the Steel Hearts.&quot; 

He seemed to look her over, curious as to who she was, &quot;Forgive me if I might be too intrusive, but I do not believe I have encountered one of your people before. Might I ask what your people are called?&quot; </div>

My apologies! I am a Genasi, I know we aren&#39;t the most common of people but I suppose I forget that at times.&quot; A chuckle escaped her as again the smile returned to her face. She was quick to fall back into that happy welcoming state of hers without fail. 

&quot;How long have you been here Uthal? But a few days or weeks? Oh and where are my manners, who is your friend over there?&quot; She would turn her gaze toward Mors and then give an energetic wave over to him. Despite the fellows appearance even it didn&#39;t seem to stop her from trying to quickly give a greeting and a warm smile. </div>

Mors just smiled a little, the shadows of his helmet only letting others to see his glowing eyes. &quot;Very well hunter, I shall let you know when the next lesson is going to take place.&quot; The overlord declared, his voice eachoing around the place with dark power, and was about to depart when he noticed the pale woman waving at him. Very familiar indeed, he thought.

Mors just grunted and shook his head before starting to walk away, later he would ask the hunter if he had found a mate as well but for now he had taken long enough and didn&#39;t want to be away from his very pregnant mate for so long, so with heavy thundering steps the overlord departed from the top deck. The shadows that had been unaturally dark and were moving in strange ways returned to normal now that the dark overlord was not near anymore. </div>

But when he did not, instead disappearing from the top deck, he would reply &quot;That is Mors. Might be hard to tell beneath that armor, but he too is a fellow Goliath.&quot; 

&quot;As for myself, I have been here for only a short while, a few days at most.&quot; he would say, then addressing her response to his question of her people. &quot;Genasi...I apologize, but I have not heard of the Genasi. Are your people related to celestials at all? You seem quite...radiant compared to most people I&#39;ve met so far, and you share the clear kindness they are reputed for.&quot; he then added on; he was being honest here, but to an outsider it might seem like he was &#39;hitting on her&#39;, as some humans might put it. </div>

After explaining she seemed to mull over his words for a time, shortly tilting her head before letting out a giggle. &quot;You say such kind things, thank you for this hospitality.&quot; For the moment she merely swayed in place with that same telltale smile plastered there. </div>

He pondered for only a moment to answer her own question though, &quot;If I do become an object of legend, it will be a result of my actions, not the cause for them. No, I joined because I wished to test myself. To see how far I could go. If I am to prove myself worthy of this life, I must release myself from stone and become as the mountain does. A monument to might and power, and able to take on even the strongest of monsters, be they wyrm or dragon or hydra. And if my actions also help people be free to live their lives, then I will take solace in that as well.&quot; he would say to her. </div>

&quot;I appreciate the offer, and extend the same to you. Should you require any aid on your journey into the annals of legend, I would be happy to assist you; surely such a trek would lead to grand tests of strength I can use to better myself.&quot; he would say, adding with a genuine smile as he crossed his arms, &quot;Who knows, perhaps our feats will overshadow those of any other one day.

&quot;I am curious however...This Church you speak of, is it the same of the Churches humans attend? Where they recite prayers to a deity or guardian spirit and offer tokens to them?&quot; he then asked; it was more than clear he&#39;d only seen one facet of religion, and probably just didn&#39;t understand how institutionalized faith behaved. </div>

Such exciting prospects don&#39;t you agree?&quot; She visibly bounced on her heels, giggling aloud as she thought of this uncertain future of hers, already alight with that same exuberant energy. If it weren&#39;t for her features one might mistake her for a giddy child with a secret.

&quot;Oh? Well yes it is, I attended the church within my hometown under my father&#39;s direction, he said I would learn quite well there and that they would help to keep me safe. As for tokens...well do have offerings but I believe you&#39;re thinking of tithes, we didn&#39;t collect money for our belief, money is a matter of mortals after all. We reveled in prayer and worship, the acquisition of knowledge, and the furthering of the Light.&quot; She let out a content sigh, seemingly staring out into the nothing.

&quot;Do you follow any gods Uthal? I would not be cross if you didn&#39;t...but perhaps we might share in prayer at some point? Or I could share some of the scripts with you if you&#39;d like?&quot; Her eyes were hopeful as she gazed at him, still slowly bouncing on her heels all the while. </div>

I was passing through a town to turn in a hunt for some Giant Crabs when I heard him delivering a sermon, telling his people to bring forward the tithes and the offerings.&quot; he would reply; honestly the idea of collecting money for a deity seemed...absurd. The Gods and spirits of the world were above material gains, from what he&#39;d been told of the elders of his tribes; why would they need a mortal&#39;s coin? 

However, his musing was interrupted when she asked if he himself followed any gods. Shaking his head, &quot;I do not, at least not in the conventional sense; in my tribe and among many Goliaths in general, we follow a spirit known as the Mother of the Mountains. It is She who blesses us with strength, who gives us the power to be shaped by the winds of the world. She requires no offerings; all that is asked is we thank her for the forces to mould us, to allow us to attain and surpass the might of the mountain. I would not be remiss in joining you in a prayer, however; I often perform a ritual every few lunar cycles to connect with the beasts of this world. Perhaps I can convince you to join me in that some time as well.&quot; </div>

&quot;The Mother of the Mountains? She sounds impressive, a worthy name to devote oneself to.&quot; Even without following his faith her eyes seemed to track him with every word, focused solely upon these descriptions of ritual and purpose he laid forth. &quot;Oh?

The whole world was an altar for those who followed the Mother of the Mountains, all that was needed was an openness to accept her blessing and allow the annals of time to shape you, to brave the greatest challenges and emerge as a pillar of strength. 

&quot;The ritual requires nothing of a material sort, no coin, no powders or stones. Only a willingness to open oneself to the world and commune with the beasts that inhabit it; it is a ritual practiced among all hunters of the Katho-Olavi. It allows us to be at one with nature, to learn of the world how the animals see it, and experience a different viewpoint. It is interesting what they can tell you.&quot; he would reply to her, giving her a slight smile; he&#39;d never done this ritual with another person before, so he would be curious to see if it were possible to experience it the same way as he did. </div>

Opening oneself to the Light, to let it guide you in all things and give you strength...perhaps our beliefs are not too wildly different.&quot; She seemed to contemplate even her own words for a time, what a strange thing to think...would others consider such a thing blasphemous? Hmm...surely, but not her, she only concerned herself with learning further of what differences they may yet have. Though such things only seemed to be a difference in name and method of prayer so far, which to say she was pleasantly surprised on.

&quot;Uthal, I would be overjoyed to join you in this ritual when you might have me, and I am equally glad to bring you along for my prayers whenever you&#39;ve the time. Shall we discuss dates then? I have no plans yet, this place hasn&#39;t offered me any outstanding work so I am as free as a dove at the moment.&quot; Her excitement was visible in both smile and that same repetitious bouncing of her heels against the deck below. </div>

She seemed open, and he would be happy to share the experience with her. 

&quot;Yes...Let us talk of times; I am available most times if I am not out hunting.&quot; he would say, adding &quot;I will admit I am not very familiar with spiritual rites, but from  what you have told me so far I think I can manage. Most gatherings at places of worship I have seen seem to occur regularly, on a schedule almost like...how do the humans say it...like clockwork. But as for myself, I too am free anytime for the foreseeable future.&quot; he would say.

Is it amicable?&quot; As they spoke she seemed to notice an errant bit of dust against herself which she brushed away, shortly after though she noticed something against Uthal and reached over to brush it away from his shoulder. &quot;Stray hair.&quot; 

She returned to her former position, smile and all as she awaited an answer, before a thought came to mind. &quot;It&#39;s funny isn&#39;t it? Our times are opposite for seeking praise and yet they both seem so close to the same, it&#39;s like two sides of a coin.&quot; She would cover her mouth for a moment as she let out a giggle. &quot;Forgive me, this meeting seems so much like those that I&#39;d find in my books.&quot; </div>

She nearly moved in to hug him again but managed to shortly stop herself. &quot;Ahh, my apologies, I was quite excited. I so rarely am able to share any stories these days, all the other sisters already knew them by heart as well and I must have told the others in the village a hundred times over.&quot;

Even so, to see her so full of life was refreshing; he could not help himself but smile around her. Seeing such freedom in one&#39;s soul was a liberating sight, to know there were those that lived for their own purpose, not bogged down by conformity. Though he did raise his arms in alarm as she hugged him again; twice now, she had done this. But...It was also nice, in a way. And slowly, he decided to test the comfort zone, and tried to return the hug. It would be more than clear he hadn&#39;t really done this before; hugging in such an intimate manner was not practiced among the Katho-Olavi, it was more instanced like the &#39;handshake&#39; humans did. 

&quot;You are quite welcome.&quot; he would reply, patting her on the back uncertainly; she was quite warm and her being seemed to be just...calming to be around. Once the gesture was finished, he would say, &quot;I apologize for any rudeness, but I must head back; I have to return the bow and arrows to Nash. If you like, you may accompany me...Unless your plan was to stay up here and enjoy the cool sky breeze of course.&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Hearing that he was intrigued by the tales alone was enough to make that especially bright smile of hers stay glued. Truly the mere act of someone being interested in what she might say was brightening her day, and in turn she did her best to brighten others. She had so many stories to possibly pick that her racing mind didn&#39;t stop until she felt the Goliath hug her back albeit clumsily. It got a chuckle out of her.

Feeling that strong hand pat at her back she let out a sigh and gazed up at him before she too eventually let go. &quot;Oh? I would happily come along with you, I&#39;ve no business anywhere else today. Keeping you company seems like a much more interesting venture than the breeze, it shall always return after all.&quot; Softly giggling again she would sway almost in place, she plans now and they were glorious ones at that. To participate in and learn of another&#39;s culture and to mosey around with a newly met acquaintance about a ship. Both were excellent ventures on their own but together in just the span of a few days? Already this ship was truly a wonderful experience in comparison to the small room back at the Abbey. 

&quot;As we walk together we may yet learn more of one another&#39;s journeys perhaps? Or perhaps I might even recount some of the tales I know more by heart for you. Anything to help with shortening the trip, having fun makes time seem so much shorter after all doesn&#39;t it?&quot; Another giggle loosed her lips as she stared up expectantly at him, like a child awaiting an answer from a guardian. There was a sense of innocence about here...not naive though, merely retaining the sort of happy nature that only young ones had the capability to exude. It was almost like she never let hardship or the worries of a day weigh her down. </div>

Let us be on our way then....&quot; Uthal would say; he would leave the targets up for now, as he did not know when Mors might want another lesson. Would be wasted effort, and besides, he&#39;d cleared it with Guildmaster Clay to allow live weapons fire on the top deck of the ship. He would excuse himself before going to retrieve the arrow from the dummy; some coin would be needed to replace the one that  was lost, but that was fine. Mors was learning, or rather &#39;re-learning&#39; the ability to fire a bow; how many had he lost or broken during his own practice?

&quot;I would be delighted to hear more of your travels.&quot; Uthal replied; there was much to be learned in talking with others, and perhaps he could learn more about these &#39;knights&#39; while they were conversing. 

As the pair might step inside, the bundle of birds at his hips swinging a bit, he would ask &quot;What did you do before you came here? You had spoken of your sisters and &#39;the Light&#39;. I am curious as to what sorts of adventures you might have had before  joining.&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">&quot;Before I was here? Ahh well...as a sister of the Light I was tasked with learning of our faith&#39;s messages and tenets at first. My father put me there initially for my protection, places held holy are often the safest after all, but they helped me cultivate my magic there as well. I studied away at our stories, languages, and many other things really. I was not trained as a guard though or anyone who would fight...we weren&#39;t sent out to deal with any such issues as we were too young. But I studied hard! I rose up above some of the others and given time I was tested to see my capabilities...I even learned to defend myself!&quot; She beamed with pride, a smile across her face that practically lit up a room.

&quot;My journeys were...well hardly adventures, but I explored and helped where I could, offered my skills in medicine and my Spells to help small towns after my father passed. I eventually heard of this place and...really that&#39;s all there is to tell. I haven&#39;t explored very much or slain great beasts but I hope to become stronger through my efforts here! One day I might be recorded even...make a good difference for this weary world or...even just one soul.&quot; Quietly he hands went back over her heart, squeezing one another as she let out a sigh. &quot;I know I am capable...but I must still go through the trials this world has to offer, you seem to understand that as well don&#39;t you?&quot;

Her smiling face gazed back up at his, she had lofty aspirations but equally so did she seem to understand that they required great effort. Perhaps she would prove to be a good ally, given time and experience. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Uthal merely listened as Celia told her story before joining the Steel Hearts; so she was sheltered from the harsh realities of the world at a young age. Not how his own tribe raised children, but it wasn&#39;t his business to pry beyond that. At her mentioned of learning more about magic, he seemed to give an approving nod; given their stony nature and relatively lack of defining facial features, many found Goliaths hard to read. It didn&#39;t help that most never shared their opinions on the matters; it was something almost every Goliath tribe had in their culture. 

Personal freedom was paramount above all else, and that extended not just to themselves, but to everyone that was in this world with them. Only when she might finish her story did he speak, &quot;Even a walk down a mountain path can be an adventure, Celia; all it takes is the want and drive to make it one. That is something the elders of my clan taught me at an early age. If you want, then take it.&quot;

Letting himself pause for a second to watch the halls for any obstructions, &quot;This world will not give you true adventure, as my own father once told me. No, that is reserved for those that truly desire it. And you...I can see it in your eyes, and how you hold yourself. You desire it, to become something great; a noble want. Among most Goliaths that type of spirit is greatly admired. Keep that mindset, and I have little doubt you will find what you want one day.&quot; he would tell her, his own lips curling into a slight smile; it was interesting, to see how aspirations drove people. And it reminded him every day that his own wants were his alone, that the desire to ascend oneself was a common trait in all living things. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Her face was practically beaming as he spoke now, such kind words and wisdom freely shared to her without issue. Her hands squeezed together over her chest momentarily as she simply gazed from the floor and back up to him. Eventually though she gave thanks in the only way she saw proper and again Uthal saw himself being hugged though from the side now. &quot;Thank you for such kind words, most might say that I am dainty or unable to handle myself within this place. You have shown me otherwise and it is an excellent surprise!&quot; Her smile shone through it all, wide and bright as always, capable of lighting up a room.

Of course given the positioning of this once again sudden hug would Uthal only be met with Celia squished to his side and all the...&quot;problems&quot; that brought with it. The Genasi hardly seemed to notice or care but perhaps that&#39;s more due to her focus having been squarely on thanking him. &quot;You are a kind soul, one I would be happy to help in battle or outside of...should you ask of my assistance of course! I assure you that I shall repay your kindness with my own, I only need the opportunity to do so!&quot; And again did she squish herself closer with a quick squeeze before finally releasing him from the death grip that was her hug, at least it was soft while it lasted.

&quot;Actually, is there anything you might need help with now? Even something minor? I know you are bringing something back to a fellow called...Nash right? If there is anything past that I&#39;d be happy to assist further.&quot; She smiled wide and managed to let out a short giggle, in pure excitement at the prospect of assisting her newfound friend. This is why she wanted to join this place...not just glory but to see new people and speak with them of their problems, to be a helpful beacon or a gentle companion with which to talk to. Anything to help out others of course. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">&quot;If that opportunity ever does arise, then I will gladly accept your assistance.&quot; Uthal said; though he was more than a little  surprised as Celia hugged him once more; he could certainly feel how &#39;soft&#39; she was, but he was honestly trying to not think about it. This was meant as a means to know her better, as he had done with Mors. And even though she was far more dainty than he, she embraced him with a rather impressive amount of force. He could get used to that feeling, and wondered if it was the same feeling Mors experienced with Irithriel might have hugged on him. 

&quot;Hmmm...At the moment, I cannot think of anything that I might need help with. But yes, right now I am returning these bows to Nash, then taking these birds to the storerooms so that their meat might be used to help us nourish the others on this ship.&quot; Uthal replied, motioning to the bundle of strung-up birds; it was all he was able to get for the moment, as hunting seemed to be rather lean. Still, his previous hauls had been rather impressive, so he doubted they would run out of food. 

&quot;Although...I am curious, what  sorts  of magic did you study while at this &#39;church&#39;? There were a few amongst my clan that were gifted in such arts, but it seems to be a fairly uncommon talent among Goliaths.&quot; he would then ask her, as they approached the <span class="mention">#steel-forge</span> </div>

My magic is of the light...which of course would include fire. It shines brightly, radiant, and it burns just like a real fire would. I would demonstrate but my Spells are destructive in nature aside from a few...though you aren&#39;t exactly in need of a Light given our surroundings, or guidance for the moment.&quot; She merely shook her head and continued to follow him.

&quot;So you hunt for the ship? How often do you take this up? And if you are doing it from the deck there I must admit I am quite impressed none of your birds fall to the ground below when you&#39;ve struck them.&quot; She kept gazing up at him as the two walked along, her cheery smile was more light than the room needed as well honestly. &quot;Most fellows back in the village would have traded home and heart for such skill with a bow, to be able to take away flying birds like mere targets.&quot;

She merely smiled and left him to think on her words for now, still following along without a care as they approached the distant forge. Her nose sniffed curiously at the new arriving scents of said place...this was sure to be interesting. </div>

Not particularly caring about anything the branding on his shoulder was visible to those who wanted to look. Reaching the top deck he finds an area suitable for his needs. Taking out his rapier he holds it straight up in front of him. Taking a deep breath he begins his movement. A dance almost, using his momentum to make wide arches and quick jabs into the air. Thrusting and partying into a seemingly invisible enemy. It was a dance he learned in school growing up and what he perfected once he recieves his prized sword. Introducing kicks into his routine he seems to glide across the ground before moving up to pierce a much taller enemy. Not entirely paying attention around him.

It takes a minute of pacing and hair tugging for Thrin to finally swear to themself and turn back to Hal. For a moment, their mind is filled with recent memories- denoxian guards, swords, months of tearing down wanted posters bearing previous disguises and the only name they&#39;d ever used, and still could never make themself change. Being blamed for all that death, so much blood being painted on their innocent hands. 
&quot;It- it&#39;s complicated...&quot; They say, staring just beyond Hal&#39;s shoulder at a small cloud. &quot;maybe I could just. Show you. Yeah. Yeah I&#39;ll just show you.&quot;
Color melts from their skin, turning lively copper brown to the purest white a person has ever been. Black hair grows into a shaggy, tangled mess of silver, and thrin&#39;s clothes seem ill fitting on their now shorter, thinner frame. Though their eyes are solid white, it&#39;s obvious that they&#39;re refusing to look at Hal, as they tug their longer hair anxiously. 
&quot;.... Changelings practically illegal some places y&#39;know,&quot; Thrin mutters, sounding almost terrified. -Got-gotten in a lotta shit telling the wrong people what I am.&quot; <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="30-Aug-20 11:44 PM">(edited)</span></div>

                    <div class="markdown">Hal turned around and leaned lightly against the ship’s rail. Her crystal blue eyes focused on Thrin, noting the nervous way they moved and spoke. She bit down on her full lower lip, while she waited, suddenly seeing Thrin’s shift right before her eyes. A changeling. Thrin was a changeling. It actually explained so much—the reason why they weren’t in fact an elf and seemed to have this strange paranoia looming over them like a death shroud. 

In a way, it was rather peculiar. Changelings were rather common in the Feywild. The Baron has befriended a few in the fairy courts, calling on some for particularly difficult jobs requiring the best. They were masters of disguise. Brought in to teach the inner circle how to mimic even the strangest of accents. Their skills were near impeccable, something most aspired to emulate when it came to their jobs as elite spies for the shadow marked house. 

“They aren’t where I’m from,” Hal explained. “They train us, walk free and proud among the fairies and sylvans in the courts of the fey.” The girl flicked her fiery hair, wild wisps blowing in the gentle breeze. “Though I’m sorry to hear that isn’t so elsewhere. But you’re in a guild now. One that will see to your safety.” It seemed a logical thing to understand. It was the promise Cassius Clay had made them all. They were all family now and that had to count for something. Didn’t it? “But your secret is safe with me,” she went on. “It hardly matters what you are so long as you’re there for others in the guild when it matters. So if you want to be an elf, that’s fine. But best to learn all about my kind first. I suggest finding a way to always have dark vision to start.” It wasn’t an insult, but a sincere idea. “If you need to know more about my kind to pass off as an elf, I can help you. Just let me know.” She gave Thrin a smile then and turned to look back out at the scene below them. </div>

It doesn&#39;t make sense. Their mind is flooded with the past, shouted accusations of being a liar, a traitor, a thief. A spy. Groups they&#39;d been banished from. Company that abandoned the young changeling. 

This didn&#39;t make sense.

&quot;...right.&quot; they change back to their recognizable form and cautiously move to lean against the rail as well. It really is a gorgeous view. &quot;... Why aren&#39;t you upset.&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">”Look,” Hal went on, her hands gripping the railing. “I do understand that there are those who cast judgment for every little thing. But...” She let out a soft exhale. “I’m not one of them. It hardly matters to me what you are. The only thing that ever bothered me was that you lied to your own guild mates. To those who were to have your back.” The girl wasn’t quite sure how to explain, but she figured she’d try her best. 

“If we are a guild and we are to look out for one another then we need to be up front about certain things. I hardly expect to know every detail, but when there’s something that could compromise our safety...” Hal’s voice trailed, and she then moved to lean her weight forward upon the rail. “That’s dangerous for everyone. Including you. But no. No. In general, I’m not upset. I’d rather help you perfect the disguise if it’s one you have your heart set on. Safer for everyone if you get it right,” she mused. “And safer your allies are aware of your plans.”

Hal’s intensely blue eyes stared down below, her gaze fixed upon the fields of various shades of green. “But I do know what it’s like to have to use disguises, to be forced to infiltrate in instances you don’t even approve of or want no part of at all. Back in the Feywild, I was part of an elite inner spy ring for the matriarch of my house. Within my house, I’m a princess of sorts, though I hardly deserve the title. But my aunt saw to it that my skills were honed and focused. I was trained by the best... several had been changelings believe it or not.” She paused a moment and looked at Thrin. “But who am I to judge and your past is your own. So it’s about how you choose to be for your guild moving forward that matters. At least to me. The rest is just irrelevant.” </div>

Their grip releases and Thrin stands on one of the lowest bads of the safety rail, as if an extra few inches will make any difference in the view. Oddly, they look more relaxed in this dangerous position. &quot;I&#39;ve never met an elf that really made me want to be like any of you- a lot of elves I&#39;ve met are pompous idiots who don&#39;t know deadly nightshade from a common blueberry.

Her blue eyes noted the precarious way in which the changeling leaned their own weight against the same rail. “Trust me, I do know what you mean about some elves,” she went on a bit bemusedly. “I know several who fit your description perfectly.” She thought on Irithriel’s brother and the elf her family had intended her to marry. 

Hal shook her head, red curls blowing in the fresh breeze. “But some of us certainly do not. Just like you do not wish to be so judged by presumption and rumor, so do others.” She stood up and away from the rail, heading to the nearby bench. “But enough of that,” she continued. “I truly don’t mind extending the help nor do you need to share why you prefer the guise of an elf. My only request... please keep your tiefling friend on some sort of leash. He was out of line the other day and I honestly didn’t care for it. I truly don’t like feeling as if I have to avoid people.

We were all each other had, and it&#39;s pretty much the same now.&quot; Thrin sighs and shifts their weight as a strong wind blows against their side. They remember more, older memories of tears and terror and the sound of their siblings cries of anger. &quot;Even now that we found each other, I can&#39;t help but worry that I&#39;ll wake up one day and Ferry will be gone again...&quot;

The wizard trails off, wondering what in the world is making them bare their soul to this almost-stranger. This isn&#39;t good. They shouldn&#39;t be so vulnerable with Hal. She could still turn on them... But she said herself that they were guildmates, and she said that counted for something.

Though he might not have known it, his words had been quite hurtful, and made her leery to be in his presence for fear of enduring the same nonsense as before. Finally, the girl sighed and nodded. 

“I know what it’s like to lose family,” Hal decided to divulge. “My own brother... we were forced to be separated and the horrors he is probably suffering makes my heart break.” She lowered her gaze to the floor. “I plan to rescue him though. It’s my fault he’s suffering in the first place. All because he wanted to protect me.”

Hal’s chest tightened and she felt her eyes sting a little from tears. But she wiped them away and dug deep to maintain her composure. “And I’ll be honest. I’m not proud of some of my past choices. But I hope to one day rise above that and actually be worth something in the end. I don’t expect the path to come easily and so far it surely hasn’t.” She chuckled softly then. “But that’s the way of it. We learn. We do better. It’s the now that defines us. Nothing more. I... I <em>have</em> to believe that.” She turned towards Thrin, crystalline eyes meeting theirs. “I’m sure you’ll find the rest of your family, if you haven’t yet. Make it a goal and don’t let anyone cause you to deviate.”

For a moment, Hal paused. “You know. If you want to perfect being an elf, the first thing you need is dark vision. Is there a spell for that? I wonder if you could learn something like that.” </div>

I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not my place to say, but the decisions of other people can&#39;t logically be your fault. You&#39;re pretty fucking great as far as I can tell. My siblings did the same thing for me, and I can&#39;t even say if Rowan and Timir are alive or not anymore, but the choices they made were their own.&quot; 
The wizard clears their throat awkwardly. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I don&#39;t want to assume anything about you, it&#39;s just my opinion. I hope you&#39;re able to rescue him, though. You shouldn&#39;t have to lose your family in exchange for your own freedom. 
&quot;In any case, yes, there are spells. I haven&#39;t found time to learn them before, but maybe now that I&#39;ve settled in one residence I might have the chance to do it.

Hal then nodded and sat back on the bench, lifting a leg to cross it over the other. She flicked a wild red tendril over her shoulder, a cascade of curls falling along her back. “Well, you should probably look into both,” she said, referring on how to ensure Thrin had darkvision. “If your goggles got stolen or broken, you’d have a spell to back it up. And will it always be appropriate to wear goggles? There might be times it arouses suspicion.” The red head tapped her lower lip. “I do think it’s in your best interest to have all bases covered.” The girl grinned then and raked her fingers through her hair. 

“There’s also the accent,” Hal mused. “Might want to consider lessons to improve that. I can help you, if you want. Not sure how great a teacher I’d be, but it’s a start and should at least get you in the right direction to impersonate an elf.” She smiled then. “I want you to be able to fool me eventually,” she encouraged. </div>

The idea of being able to fool a real elf (or orc, or dwarf) with their disguise has always been an unnerving and unattainable goal.

Their dialect is a little crass as well, that&#39;s true, but they&#39;ve never thought of it to be an issue if they&#39;d taken the right form. &quot;We&#39;ll see, I guess. But uhhhh what accent? Is it Denoxian?&quot;
Thrin chews their lip anxiously and glances away. They hope it isn&#39;t. They don&#39;t want to be pinned as anything related to that gods-forsaken country, that&#39;s for certain. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Hal shook her head, and then pushed away the red curls that had fallen in front of her face. “Denoxia?” she reiterated quizzically. “No. I’m not familiar with that. I’m originally from the Feywild and have only recently spent time in this plane. I’m afraid I’m not sure what you’re talking about.” The elf saw no reason to hide her lack of knowledge here. It wouldn’t help anyone to pretend otherwise. 

Though, while Hal explained, she noticed Thrin‘s agitation. They seemed nervous yet again. Though why? “Is there a problem with Denoxians?” she then asked. “Politics or something else?” The girl understood the terrible intrigue of politics on a personal level having been the adopted daughter of her aunt—Baron Elvinor Ellorenthi. While she’d been honed into a vicious spy and assassin, she’d also been manipulated against the very ideals her own parents had held. Innocent and clueless that her aunt had murdered her parents and hurt her friend’s family. </div>

The wizard flops against the railing and looks up at Hal, pulling their hat off to achieve it properly. &quot;It&#39;s uh... It&#39;s complicated, but basically everything there sucks. It&#39;s a strong country for sure, and it&#39;s where I grew up, but I don&#39;t belong there. Anyone who doesn&#39;t align with the country&#39;s values  is pretty thoroughly shunned, so... imagine growing up around people who think I should be proud of the life I were born to and embrace it, but hate that what I was born with is the ability to change my face as easily as my clothes.&quot; <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="08-Sep-20 12:48 AM">(edited)</span></div>

                    <div class="markdown">Hal chuckled inwardly knowing full well what it was like to grow up under such circumstances. Her own aunt had molded her, honed her into the perfect little princess assassin. She’d been taught how to mingle with the fey at court, while perfecting those deadlier skills to infiltrate enemies. She was Ellorenthi. And the Baron wanted her to exude the power she’d deluded herself to believe it meant. But it was merely a name, and not even a founder, though it had been a bloodline always held high regard. Nobility. 

But in the end, Hal hadn’t wanted that.  She had no interest in thrones or power. All she’d ever wanted was a proper family. To be cherished and loved and wanted. And now poor Keth was there with their aunt. All alone. Vulnerable. 

“I think I have an idea...” Hal mumbled, those memories still so fresh and raw. “Why do you think I left the Feywild? My home?” She sighed softly. “But I have to go back for my brother. And I will.” The red head paused a moment. “And then we’ll never go back. Not until my aunt is overthrown.” It was a promise of sorts. In her heart, she longed for a Phiarlan—the <em>right</em> Phiarlan—to lead her people to peace. </div>
