Despite the magic she felt everywhere, there was something different about the ship. Deciding not to dwell, she merely entered her room and inspected it. It was decorated in a way quite familiar to her, the space very similar to the room she’d had back when she’d been the Baron’s favorite. In that moment, she thought of Keth, wondering if he was all right or somehow suffering at the hands of the Phiarlan matriarch she and her brother used to see as a mother. Her expression darkened then, her crystal colored eyes welling with tears. She placed a hand on her chest, desperate to keep her emotions and sorrow hidden. Now it was time to regroup and recharge and perhaps make a friend or two. She needed to make up for lost time, to find a way to save her family. At that she left her room and headed to <span class="mention">#the-top-deck</span>. </div>

When Hal reached her room, her free hand moved to push on her door, causing it to swing open with an audible creak. The girl entered her little sanctuary, the place she’d been given to turn into her own. She had to admit she rather liked her little living space. It was definitely decorated to her liking, making her feel both relaxed, as well as safe. Her blue eyes roamed the space, finally settling on those library books. She licked her lips then and picked up the large tomes. She set them down on her bedside table, her body then collapsing on her bed making it squeak. The girl giggled then and sat up, placing her pan flute off to the side. Yes, she was ready to tackle those books even if it took all night! <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="20-Jun-20 10:29 AM">(edited)</span></div>

Her pan flute now rested on the bedside table, as her lithe elven body draped over her bed, while she read page after page of information. Her mind was swimming—quite literally—with so much information, she wasn’t quite sure how to process it. From what she’d gathered, sharkin were rather unique and rare and it made her question entirely what she was even reading. This kraken also seemed rare, an ocean monstrosity not even of this plane. It was baffling and a lot to take in. The girl knew she’d have to read more and possibly search for other sources, but she’d finish with these first and foremost before doing that. Her eyes then glanced at another book—one about factions, organizations, guilds. Of course, she suspected to find information about Clocktower in there, and she feared just what sorts of horrors she’d begin to uncover the moment she delved into those pages. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="27-Jun-20 06:12 AM">(edited)</span></div>

&quot;Shadow girl!&quot; He roared while kicking her door open, making a lot of noise. &quot;Just the person I need now! Here...&quot; And he threw the pipes at her, not caring that she was on the bed and probably wouldn&#39;t catch them. &quot;You told me you could play this little fucker. Show me.&quot; He just... Demanded. The sharkin took a step forward and used his tail to close the door, once again making the poor thing crash. He crossed his arms over his chest and just stood there, looking at Hal and waited. </div>

He’d slammed the door shut behind him, her eyes moving frantically between him, her books, the pipe. “I... I...” she stammered, trying to orient her thoughts, when she quickly grabbed her books and tried to shove them under her pillow. 

Hal winced then, trying to stay calm and collected. She then reached for the pipes, remembering her offer to teach the shark back on the job they’d done together not long ago. Holding the strange instrument in her hands, she finally nodded. “Sure,” she began. “Give me a moment to get the feel of them, they are a bit different than my own, but similar enough.” She gave him a smile then and took the instrument Garg had thrown onto her bed. As she situated herself, she brought the pipes to her lips, and blew. </div>

&quot;You said you could play it. So play.&quot; He said after hearing her words. Even if she wasn&#39;t the best at least it would give him an idea of how to play the thing. He saw the big chair in front of the bed and moved to sit there, probably making a damp spot since his leather pants weren&#39;t totally dry but like always he didn&#39;t care.

Eyes fluttering closed, she let her delicate and nimble fingers move over the little holes that allowed the instrument to make sound. A few scales later and the red head had the feel of it, the thing close enough to other wind instruments she already knew how to play. With confidence, the girl then began playing a familiar tune, a haunting melody from her childhood. As she played, she thought on Keth, on Ettrian. Even the Baron Elvinor. As the sound filled the room, she looked back over at the shark, hoping this proved well enough she could play the thing. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="21-Jun-20 11:32 AM">(edited)</span></div>

He could recognize the elf skill but he could also detect the dark hidden powers of the instrument. Just like with the shadow squid, it probably took the right person with the right set of skills and intentions to unleash it&#39;s full potential.

While he listened, his smile widened even further. Only he was this lucky, to find everything he needed so easily.

After she was done with her tune, the shark whistled. &quot;Well, color me fucking impressed shadow girl... You can flay the thing but now comes the real challenge. How the fuck do I do that?&quot; He asked, more amused than anything else because even he knew that shaking physiology, to be more precise his shark mouth, made things different and/or awkward for them to learn. Yes, learn because he will learn to play the damn thing. Failure was for weak fuckers and he was not weak anymore. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">As soon as Hal stopped and Garg’s words registered in her head, she felt a sudden heat rise to her cheeks, turning her face a rosy shade of red. Still holding the instrument, she let it rest against her lap and then bit down on her full lower lip, blue eyes moving to look at the sharkin before her. 

“Well,” Hal started, clearing her throat a little before continuing on. “It’ll just take some practice.” She shifted on the bed, fidgeting slightly with the pipe that she held. “But, you learned to speak, so you can learn to play.” The girl swallowed then, unsure if what she was about to suggest would go over well or not. But, she was a musician. Had training. She knew what he needed to hear, to do was absolutely necessary. 

“Umm... you just need to practice your embouchure. That’s all,” Hal went on, her eyes now focused on Garg’s mouth. “It... it requires exercises. Exercises for your lips...” The girl felt her mouth go dry. Oh gods, did he even have lips? “And umm... your tongue and... teeth...” At that, she looked away, her grip on the instrument tightening, knuckles starting to turn white. She was making a mess of things. Surely he’d find a way to make fun of her. 

Trying to push past things, Hal merely continued. “Without realizing it, you did the same when learning to speak. So... so now you do so for... for this.” She reached out her hand, holding the pipes out for Garg to retrieve. “Why not give it a try? I... I can see what needs work and can maybe... suggest things to help. But...” She looked back up at him, her blush having darkened and now sweeping down her neck. “But I’ll make sure you learn them. I... I promise.” </div>

He remembered in days as a pup, aquan was like breathing for him, like the language was in his shark blood. But common had been another matter entirely. &quot;My mother&#39;s a human. While I learned to speak aquan first and could talk with the old bastard, it took me a while to speak with my <em>momma</em>...&quot; That word was probably the only soft sounds he could make that didn&#39;t appear to be an angry growl. &quot;The old bastard tried to help but apparently even being his son I&#39;m a different kind of fuckin sharkin. Compared to common sharks he&#39;s a white one while I&#39;m a blue one. Our heads are different so common was easier for him but that didn&#39;t stop me and in the end I could speak with my momma... Ha! The first thing I managed to said was &#39;Fucl you!&#39; because she kept making me go to play with that dumb Marina.&quot;

He took the pipes then and tried to follow Hal&#39;s example but before starting he wanted to mess with her a little. &quot;You look like a fuckin tomato, I can smell your blood filling your face. What is it shadow girl? You embarrassed &#39;cause I caught you reading smut? Ha! I fuckin saw you hiding some books under you pillows!&quot;

The girl looked up at Garg, her lips puckered into a small pout, as she hoped to make him see reason. “I... I’m not hiding anything like that or... or...” Her fingers moved to her hair, twisting a red tendril wildly about it. “Or anything at all!” She winced then, tummy all a flutter with nervousness. Gods, he’d see through the lie. She was sure of it. The shark had caught her off guard with his comments. His insinuation of potential darker and hidden affairs. But... she had none. None to speak of yet, as she was certain no one could love a girl such as her. Shaking that off, she dared to meet Garg’s gaze. “And why do you care what gets me off anyway?” she attempted to counter, but her words only made her blush harder and wish she wasn’t being subject to such scrutiny... such... judgment. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="22-Jun-20 11:50 AM">(edited)</span></div>

                    <div class="markdown">While she fumbled with her words, Garg started to get a feel of the instrument. First just learning to blow air through the pipes and then trying to play some notes.

In the end while not a master he managed to play a decent tune, one that was a small piece of a very common sailor song. &quot;Well, this little fucker isn&#39;t as hard to play as I thought...&quot; He growled mostly to himself.

Then he heard Hal&#39;s words and he couldn&#39;t stop himself from laughing. Like always, the sound was more like a series of short growls since the range of sounds sharkins could make was limited awfully close to a real shark. &quot;A good captain knows how to reward his crew shadow girl! You like boobs? Or cocks? You go only for elver or you prefer another race entirely?&quot; He asked completely unashamed. &quot;After a good raid I will need to know the best place to go so I can reward my crew!! There&#39;s this island called Tortuga that has a very good place with mermaids and sirens, some centaurs and other alike. Good fucking place if you like to go half and half.&quot; He finished, wiggling his eyebrows at her.

&quot;Sharkin&#39;s may be bound to enjoy only one partner or have their instincts explode into a frenzy but I&#39;m not stupid! Ha! everyone likes to fuck.&quot; He chuckled some more even thumping the ground with his tail a couple of times. 

&quot;I tried it, was decent while it lasted but my mate was not one to be bound to a single fucker so I let her go and prepared to die. Good thing the boss took my heart away as soon as it happened. I could do it with anyone now if I fucking wanted but I have better things to do like learning to use this little fucker.&quot; He told her and prepared to play again. What he didn&#39;t tell her and probably would never admit to himself was that after having experienced that kind of connection, simple physical pleasure would never feel satisfying for him.

Distracted as he was by his memories and teasing Hal, his next try came out very bad compared to the previous one. &quot;Fuck!&quot; </div>

Even still, the shark’s crude manner had her squirming. She just wasn’t used to others being this bold or open. “I... I like men,” she managed, blue eyes looking at the floor. “Though I don’t know what sort I like. I told you... I... I’ve never been with a man. Though... all seem attractive at least, if... if that’s what you mean.” Ugh, this was the worst! Sex with others wasn’t her idea of a raid rewarded. It was something she held to be special. Perhaps no one could understand that. Perhaps she was odd for making it matter. She didn’t know. 

Feeling humiliated, embarrassed, Garg then revealed more of himself and his past. Hal pushed away her own unease and dared to look back up at the shark. She listened carefully to what he said, noting as many details as she could. “Why... why would you choose to mate with someone so... so... so incompatible?” she then asked. Wincing after she spoke, she bit down on her lip, worried her question might drag up hard feelings or bad memories. Perhaps he’d been too naive to know he’d chosen poorly? The girl thought on that for a moment, deciding she wouldn’t make the same mistake. “So, your boss took your heart?” she then pressed. “Why and where does he keep it?”

Hal looked at Garg quizzically, tilting her head a little, lost in thought. “Could you... could you ever get it back?” she then dared. “What would happen if you did?” </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Garg just kept laughing at her embarrassment. &quot;Ha! At least you like something!&quot; While Hal seemed to be gathering herself again he tried again to play the pipes. This time it was a more decent one, while it was not perfect and a couple of notes were off, he managed to complete another small tune without butcheries it like before.

&quot;Not bad...&quot; He growled to himself before looking at Hal again. &quot;I was drunk and she kept wanting to fuck the scary shark so I said &#39;why the fuck not?&#39;&quot; he shrugged like it was not the most important thing. &quot;It&#39;s very hard for a male sharkin to find a female one and even harder to find any female that doesn&#39;t run away at the sight of the teeth.&quot; He grinned then, showing her his sharp bloody teeth and biting the air a couple of times. &quot;We bite as we fuck shadow girl. And we fuck like the rucking predators we are.&quot; He wiggled his eyebrows at her.

Then he got a little more serious, his evil smile dissapearing. &quot;You really are bad at puzzles aren&#39;t ya?... Can I get it back? Yes. I would die if that happens. Sharkins literally die of heartbreak because it stops producing adrenaline...&quot; Then he looked down and growled for a few moments. &quot;Our anger is taken away and we stop wants to move. A still shark is a dead one. So we either turn crazy and kill ourselves or something else eat us.&quot;

He shook his head and raised his eyes again. &quot;But why would I want it back? I&#39;m stronger now, more in control. Now there&#39;s nothing holding me back, no more fighting my own instincts..... And that fuckers is not a male... Well I don&#39;t think so... Hard to tell.&quot; He shrugged before throwing her the pipes again, he needed to see more to improve. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Garg’s words and insinuations made Hal squirm, the poor girl unsure if she should be embarrassed, ashamed, or possibly even both. All she knew was that each time the shark poked, she felt this weird warmth envelope her whole, her skin tingling, her body feeling... strange. In those moments, she just longed to hide so no one could see her or judge. As it was, she wasn’t certain she’d ever be worthy of another’s love and affection, and she certainly had no plans of engaging in such intimacies until fortune smiled down upon her, granting her that forgiveness she so very desperately sought. 

Hal closed her eyes then, figuring maybe it would be easier to just focus on darkness. Shadow. She was always safe in the shadows. As Garg continued on, her lips turned down into a frown. A kind word... just once... but then, she figured life had decided she wasn’t deserving. At least not yet. Oh, who was she kidding? Probably not ever. “My apologies to your boss then,” she whispered before opening her eyes and meeting Garg’s gaze. “And, I... I don’t know...” she answered, regarding why he would want his heart back. Of course, she hoped she could somehow help him, fix him. Maybe return what he lost and make him whole. Perhaps then life might find her worthwhile once again? To help another was the most selfless thing another could do, especially one who seemed in such need. She saw how others reacted to him and now had an idea of his past. Someone needed to take that chance, she’d decided and so her mind had been made up. 

As Hal looked up at Garg, she reached for his flute and held it. “Just seems sad is all. I think I’d miss my heart. And if I couldn’t have it back then, well, I’d rather be its keeper until I could give it to another.” Her eyes slid to her lap then, the flute resting upon it, as her thoughts swirled. No doubt she sounded like some hopeless romantic and... perhaps she was. But it wasn’t wrong to dream or wish. Even if such things could never come true. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">&quot;Meh, I&#39;m better for it...&quot; He growled while leaning back and getting comfortable on the chair. Well, as comfortable as he could get thanks to his big tail. It was only in the water where he could be truly comfortable, there and at the helm of a sailing ship of course.

He waited for a few seconds and noticed that Hal seemed lost in her thought, &quot;There&#39;s this fucking legend about the sharkin gods that Ray kept telling me about. Each sharkin is given a heart but it is up to their mates to take care of them because we were made so strong that we needed a weakness to keep the balance...&quot; If he was good at something it was at telling a story. He thumped his tail and the shadows of his coat filled the floor of the room, turning into a living ocean of pictures. &quot;One day a megalodon, the rarest of sharkins lost his mate. Because he was so strong his blood was filled with anger, enough to last him a year. What he didn&#39;t know was that his mate had been granted life again by a land God because some bullshit she did, something about helping a mermaid fuck a human sailor without losing her voice or some bullshit like that...&quot; As he talked, he waved his tail and made the images change so while he told her the story, the pictures showed it to the elf. He wasn&#39;t looking at the improvised screen but instead bhe was looking at the ceiling like he was bored.

&quot;Anyway, the female had a year before her mate would die and while her heart wasn&#39;t broken yet, she wouldn&#39;t last much after the male&#39;s death. So she searched high and low, around all the seas until she found the fabled Heart&#39;s reef, where the sharkin gods lived and grew the hearts of every shaking.&quot; More pictures, this one of a reef that was filled with heart shaped corals. Not the idiotic shape everyone used for hearts but the true shape of one, as gruesome as they are. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">&quot;I&#39;m the end she struck a deal. They would replace her mate&#39;s heart but instead of giving him a new one, they would split hers in half and mesh both together. One dying half and one healthy half. If her heart was true, then it would easily keep them both alive. And it did but at the cost of something. Because now it was know that female sharkins heart&#39;s are twice as valuable as male ones, to keep their fucking balance those bastards made females twice as rare.&quot; He finished and thumped his tail again. All the pictures dissapearing suddenly.

&quot;Or so the legend says.&quot; Then he turned his angry red eyes at Hal, &quot;Do you need milk and cookies too or can we get going with the fucking class?!&quot; Aaaand the angry unhinged pirate captain was back. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="24-Jun-20 12:57 AM">(edited)</span></div>

                    <div class="markdown">Hal frowned a little, not satisfied that such a fate was better for anyone. There had to be... something! And the more she thought on it, the angrier she got at the girl who broke him. Did she know her actions and choices would cause this terrible cascade of events? Did she not care? Perhaps it was as Garg had said... most just want to fuck. In that moment, she decided whoever broke him was selfish. More so if they’d known he would break... die. 

As Hal’s thoughts were running away with her, she realized Garg was telling her a story. She perked up then, curled up on her bed, while she listened. His words were accompanied by pictures, shadowy images. She smiled inwardly, shadows always giving the girl some semblance of comfort. As the shark’s story unfolded, her tiny hands began gripping her sheets, knuckles going white, while her breath suddenly caught in her throat. His tale was dark, sinister, but... it gave her hope. Hope of finding this fabled reef and whatever gods kept it safe. Hope of making things right. 

Suddenly, Garg turned on her, Hal’s face once more darkening to a dusky shade of pink. “I... I might!” she retorted, but she readied his flute despite things and played it some more for him, showing the angry pirate how best to hold it. “Like this,” she said softly, having pulled it away from her lips, so he could see. Pursing her lips tightly, she then got up and dared approach the shark. “Here.” She reached for one of his hands and tried her best to manipulate his hold on the delicate instrument. He’d already shown some aptitude, so she knew it was just a matter of time. Carefully, she adjusted the way his fingers rested upon it. “This should be easier,” she explained. Once satisfied, she let her hands drop to her side. “Now, try again,” she prodded, a small smile tugging at the corners of her mouth, her way of encouraging him not to give up. Meanwhile, she wondered how one would search for this elusive Heart’s Reef. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Garg watched Hal play the pipes and explain it to him. Then when she came closer he was about to ease her again when she suddenly grabbed his hand. <em>Was she stupid or just had balls of steel?</em> He wondered, in his stupor he let her manipulate his hand without any resistance. 

It was the first time since he had become heartless that another living bein touched him. His previous hunts in the sea not counting because he was a quick killer. He was also a little overwhelmed because he could feel Hal&#39;s entire nervous system at work. The small pulses running from her heat to the rest of her body, a thing he had always been able to feel but it was always followed by the frenzy and quickly forgotten.

Despite his new control of himself, muscle memory was a thing, and before he knew it he had jumped the elf, jaws at the ready to take a bite out of her neck. They both landed on top of her on the bed, him on top of her growling like a dangerous shark and easily restraining his almost food.

 He managed to stop himself though, the tips of his teeth had already pierced her clothes and were scrapping at her skin. &quot;You are very lucky shadow girl...&quot; He growled as he pulled back, his body shuddering a little. &quot;Only because I don&#39;t have a heart... Only because of that you aren&#39;t bleeding to death right now.&quot; Then he shook his head and shrugged. &quot;I told you didn&#39;t I? Sharkin&#39;s can&#39;t go around touching anyone.&quot; Still he didn&#39;t release her. Just like the first time he smelled blood after having no heart, he needed to learn to control his instincts and he would take the nice opportunity Hal had provided him. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">One moment Hal was helping to place Garg’s hands properly on the flute, the next she was thrown onto her bed, the large shark hovering above her. She could feel his teeth barely scraping her flesh, clothes torn and disheveled. His breath was strangely cool, causing her body to shiver slightly beneath his weight. Her breath was stilled for a moment, her heart racing fast in her chest. Licking at her lips, she dared to turn her head and look up into the great sharkin’s eyes. Bright blue meeting glowing red. 

Garg’s growls then vibrated against Hal’s skin, while he spoke. His words low and gruff. She just blinked several times, her mind swirling, her senses reeling. Sure, she could have struggled or screamed, but she didn’t. Instead, she tried processing the moment and what exactly she was feeling. Trying to find her voice, she could feel her own body grow hot, strange and new sensations washing over her completely. No one had ever been so close before, at least... not like this. The girl swallowed then, feeling the small trickle of blood at her neck, a dull ache radiating in her core. 

“No, I... I wasn’t aware...” Hal finally managed. Though barely. But her eyes remained fixed on his. “Am I... am I that awful to touch?” she then asked, wondering just what it was that coursed through him, and drove him to be and react as he did. So just how would he be with his heart then? Well... half his heart. The girl now knew half of it was the best that could ever be done. And that was assuming he would even want that much. 

Still beneath Garg, Hal made no indication she planned to move. Instead, she stayed as she was, waiting for his answer and explanation. The sting at her throat no longer hurting, replaced by an oddly pleasant throb. “Well am I?” she asked again, her voice a soft whisper. </div>

Never choose a mate while drunk shadow girl, you&#39;ll end up with someone made of fire who hates water.&quot; He answered still getting a hold of himself and without really noticing telling her more that he ussually did. After a minute he blinked a couple of times, his body not shuddering anymore and he noticed that Hal wasn&#39;t really fighting against him. <em>Either she has balls of fucking steel or he&#39;s scared shitless.</em> He thought and then an idea came to him. Maybe he could kill two birds with one bite.

Without asking for her permission He pushed his nose against the bared skin of her neck, mostly because it was there where he was most sensitive to those electric impulses. As soon as his cool, smooth skin touched hers again he could feel it even more, practically see it. Her entire neural sistem, each little impulse creating a path he could follow until he could feel it all. Fuck, he hadn&#39;t noticed this with Ena... Maybe because she was practically an elemental.

&quot;Fuck, this is very useful...&quot; He growled against her skin, practically seeing how her brain received all the signals from her skin. Her heart was beating wildly but he didn&#39;t smell real fear in her blood. Fuck, she was bleeding and he hadn&#39;t noticed. He thought his sense of smell was his strongest one but apparently he was wrong.

If he really wanted to take advantage of this new discovery he needed her to stop being paralyzed. Another idea came to him so he just licked her blood from her neck, &quot;Ah, so that&#39;s what those bastards meant by fey blood... Like a spiked drink.&quot; He wanted her to do something so he could feel her reactions and what better way to do that but to keep teasing her. Just to add a little more flair to his tactics he dismissed his shadow clothes, only his leather pants remained. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="25-Jun-20 01:05 AM">(edited)</span></div>

                    <div class="markdown">Heart racing, mind whirling, Hal felt her breath catch, as soon as Garg leaned in close, closing what little gap there was left between them in that moment. She then felt his nose slide against her skin, his cool tongue suddenly lapping up the blood that he’d drawn. The girl closed her eyes, allowing her mind to process the situation. She could hear the shark mumbling against her, but she was too stunned to make sense of the words... at least he didn’t find her abhorrent? Given the way they currently were—him atop her body, the two of them on her bed—she decided this was probably a good thing. 

As her mind slowed a bit, coming to grips with everything, Hal let out a breath, a soft whimper when she realized what he’d done actually felt... good. In that moment, she felt his clothes shift, dissipating, and soon his bare chest was pressed firmly against her own. She looked up at him then, at his mercy and more, while she had no choice but remained pinned beneath his massive body. It was then when those strange sensations... delicious sensations... started to grow. Just... what was this? Her thoughts went wild, and she could feel a dull ache begin grow between her legs. 

Embarrassed at realizing she was aroused, Hal just turned her head to the side, exposing the small wound Garg had inflicted and licked. That strange heat she felt began taking over, all of it settling in her sex, making it throb in a way she never knew it could. Trying to cover up her embarrassment, she tried clearing her throat. “Spiked drink...? Blood is like alcohol?” Her words were huskier than she’d meant them to be, causing her to wince at her own vulnerability. “Is my blood... bad?” she then asked, suddenly realizing she could feel his smooth skin against her own through the tears Garg had made on her top. Again, that ache between her legs pulsed, nor could she hide the next little whimper she made. The one that betrayed just what it was she was feeling. </div>

Fuck, she&#39;s not scared for sure, she&#39;s aroused! He suddenly realized. Well, it seemed that his plan backfired because despite everything he was a male and his body reacted to the hormones as it should, making him hard. And making him realize that without his heart it was like he wasn&#39;t mated to begin with which was interesting.

Still, he needed to figure out this thing properly so a change of plan was in order. Quickly and without asking permission he changed their positions. Hal ended up sitting on his lap, facing forward while the shark was sitting at the edge of the bed. &quot;Yes shadow girl, like alcohol...&quot; he growled in he ear to distract her, so she wouldn&#39;t see the dagger fo shadows he summoned in one of his hands. &quot;Not bad, Fucking good actually... but your blood has literally magic in it and that can be addictive for the ones without magic of their own...&quot; He liked her neck again and used the dagger to cut her top with a single slash. His free hand pulled the fabric out of the way. Now her naked back was completely against his chest and once again the picture of her nerves bloomed inside his head, this time more defined.

To test his new skill he dismissed the dagger and used his fingers to pinch one of her nipples, easily seeing the strong electric pulses travel to her body, eachoing around her pussy and then rising to her head. &quot;Ah... So that&#39;s why female&#39;s like that.&quot; He growled starting to get a hold of this new thing and ignoring the fact that she was not sitting on his hard dick. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Suddenly, Hal found herself sitting on Garg’s lap, something hard poking her backside, yet nestling somehow between her legs. She wasn’t quite sure what the shark was doing, but for reasons unknown, her instincts told her to remain calm and just let him do, as was needed. More warmth flooded her at his compliments, words that might sound odd to another, but for her... it felt like praise. In its way. More so when he rewarded her by licking once more at her neck, her body arching slightly at the feelings he was making her experience by his touch. 

Just then, Hal felt her top give way, the material a tattered mess, as it fell to the floor. Just what was Garg doing now? What was he planning...? In that moment, he pinched her exposed nipple, the girl gasping at the pleasure that tore through her. “Nnggg...” she groaned, feeling her sex grow hot and wet, as it heaved with need. It was like he’d given up on the flute, her body his new instrument of choice. 

Panting heavily, Hal tried to turn her head. In doing so, her bottom rubbed against Garg’s very hard cock. “I... I had no idea...” she explained, biting down on her lower lip, these pleasant sensations gripping her mind, body, and soul. “So, you... you like my blood then?” she asked, for some reason wanting him to say yes and to taste more. It was unnerving what her body suddenly demanded, as if finally awakened from a deathly slumber. Shifting a little more, she groaned when realizing Garg was just as aroused as herself, his thick cock happily seated between her somewhat spread legs. </div>

While his plan had been to &#39;watch&#39; her movements, he still could see her reactions to his touch. It was like the waves on the ocean. The waves of energy made by his touch flowed through her system, crashing against each other. Sometimes canceling eachother and sometimes amplifying each other. &quot;Talk about a sea of pleasure...&quot; He randomly growled, probably confusing the poor girl even more.

Then his tail brushed against the forgotten pipes and he remembered part of his initial plan to kill two birds with one bite. &quot;Here, play something I want to see.&quot; He told her while passing her the instrument. He pushed his nose against her neck and wrapped his arms around her, keeping as much contact as he could. 

If he could see how her muscles worked and somewhat copy it, it would let him learn faster and train his focus while he was at it. It would be a challenge since he could see her pussy sending needy signals to her brain but that was the fun of it. Living on the edge, pushing his limits to grow stronger than any sharkin before him. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Hal was indeed confused, but one thing was very much clear—she was enjoying the way Garg touched her. Every bite, every lick, she felt another part of herself come undone. Her whimpers grew louder, more desperate, that agonizing ache now causing her clit to throb, her cunt to pulse. Why did she suddenly long for something to fill her? It was strange and new and only added to her confusion. 

Closing her eyes, Hal just gave in to how it felt being in the sharkin’s tight embrace. His arms encircled her much smaller body, holding her close, while he nibbled possessively on her neck, tasting her blood. Without realizing it, her legs were slowly spreading, instinctively moving the way nature intended when a female was ready to mate. But her eyes soon flew open when the nearly forgotten flute was thrust back into her hands. 

It was hard to concentrate now, Garg’s touch overwhelming her senses completely. “I... I... all right...” she stammered, barely able to think straight. It was as if all her nerves were firing at once. And all of them causing her body to scream out for this shark who was holding her close. Trying to reel in her senses and failing, the girl brought the instrument up to her lips. She blew, the notes coming out, while her fingers moved over the holes. She played well, all things considered, but it was hard to quiet the sensations this shark had awoken. 

A part of Hal was terrified by what she was feeling, another elated and wanting more. She could tell that her panties were now absolutely soaked, and bordering on uncomfortable as a result. His cock still throbbed against her needy sex, her legs spreading more to accommodate Garg. “How... how was that?” she then asked, breaths heavy, hips moving. She then felt her sex rub along his hard and massive length. “Oh gods...” she panted, feeling a gush from her cunt. The unexpected motion was sending jolts throughout her tiny body. Jolts causing her to whine. Jolts making her brain focus on one thing—more. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="27-Jun-20 06:10 AM">(edited)</span></div>

                    <div class="markdown">Garg had pushed his nose against the back of her neck and focused of her movements. Fuck, it was hard because her whole body was horny and getting hornier, not only masking the signals of her movements but making him horny as well.

Despite that he managed to accomplish part of what he wanted, get used to this weird sense. &quot;It was fucking decent... We should try it again next time...&quot; He growled moving to lick her neck again. &quot;Maybe when you aren&#39;t all horny on me... Unless you want me to take care of that?&quot; One of his hands sneaked under her clothes and he started to touch her pussy directly, taking special attention to her clit.

&quot;Only warning you gonna get shadow girl... If you don&#39;t stop me... You gonna end up wasting your precious virginity on the scary pirate...&quot; He was lots of things but no one will accuse him of rape. Contrary to popular belief, some thing were off the limits for true pirates since they aren&#39;t common thugs.

Suddenly he stilled and started chuckling like crazy. One of his hands was on her pussy while the other one was grabbing a boob. &quot;Ha! Didn&#39;t the round on said you are some sort of princess? This looks like one of those smut stories you were reading about!&quot; He growled very loudly in that obnoxious way of his. Anyone walking outside could probably heard his words since they were so loud. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Breaths ragged, Hal could only whimper at Garg’s crude words. Without hesitation, his hand then plunged down her pants, monstrous fingers teasing that fleshy nub that was now quivering and screaming between her legs. In that moment, her juices gushed all over his hand, her scent coating his fingers, his hand, while he teased her. She sucked in a sharp breath, her body unmoving, as she sat upon his lap, his cock hot and hard against her. He gave her the chance to bolt, if that was her choice, only her body and mind refused to leave. So, this was it, she decided. This would be her first... but would it be her only? Her heart, beating frantically, kept telling her... it was.

“I... I told you...” Hal panted, her little pussy now rocking against Garg’s hand on its own. “I wasn’t... I wasn’t reading... smut... oh god...” The way the shark was touching her, had her body needing more. It was like his touch alone unleashed something dormant within. “And... I... I suppose I am, but... nnggg...” Her little clit was begging for something, anything... everything! “My family shouldn’t be ruling...” she tried to explain. It was a long and complicated story. One involving elven intrigue and politics. No doubt something the shark would laugh at, another reason to make her feel worthless... just one kind word. Like when he praised her blood, or her music skill. 

“C-captain...” Hal whispered harshly through little mewling sounds of pleasure due to his hands’ attention to her needy body. “I... I... I won’t stop you...” Her words were final, her legs spreading further, while the scent of her arousal and blood filled the room. She had no idea what would come next. But for some reason that didn’t matter, not so long as she was with her captain. </div>

You are flooding like this for me then?&quot; He asked as his surprisingly smooth fingers started to touch her sex in a more intense way. &quot;For the big scary shark?&quot; He kept working her up, the strong scent of her arousal making everything better for him.

He had thought he wouldn&#39;t seek the pleasures of the flesh again, not really caring about fucking around but since this nice opportunity had presented itself, who was he to stop? Besides, if he managed to make her want him more, then he could easily make her follow him as part of his crew. She had a killer body too and her blood was really tasty.

He felt her spread her legs further for him and raised his hand from her breasts to her neck, turning her head around so she would look into his scary eyes. &quot;Fuck... You are fearless shadow girl... Very few females enjoy fucking a sharkin.&quot; He licked his sharp teeth, showing her the thing most creatures feared about sharks while his fingers kept working on her pussy, focusing on her clit and sometimes teasing her entrance but never pushing inside.

&quot;But look at you, all ready to go off by a couple of touches... All but begging me to fuck you. I bet you are about to cum aren&#39;t ya? Go ahead, I plan to taste you, show you pleasure you had never felt so each time you see sharp teeth you will get all hot and bothered...&quot; He made his voice rumble in the way it would when he spoke aquan so he could feel his voice with her body. His fingers moving faster, pleasuring her more. &quot;Cum for me... Make that pussy all sweet for me to devour it.&quot; Despite his dark intentions he found that he was having a great time and he planned to make this whole thing epic. No one would say that Garg fuckin DreadStorm was a bad lover. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="25-Jun-20 03:41 PM">(edited)</span></div>

                    <div class="markdown">It was true. Every little cry, every little shiver. It was all a result of Garg touching her, tasting her, making it clear she was desired. His fingers were relentless, working up her clit until it throbbed so badly, Hal couldn’t see straight. Unable to stop herself, she ground her needy sex against his masterful hand, head lolling to the side so he had access to her neck, that wound. She was on fire and despite his cool touch he was only igniting her further, making the small spark roar into mighty flame. 

Garg goaded her then, Hal’s body feeling like it might burst from all these sensations. He wanted her to cum... her first time. And for him. When his demand echoed in her mind, her soul, her body merely complied, her cunt heaving hard, as her juices just flooded his hand, causing her to scream out and sob, as if in pain. But Hal was hardly in pain, her body feeling more alive than it ever had, like it wanted this. Like it had known. It was answering to this shark, this pirate, wanting to meet his demands. 

“Nnggg... god... Garg...!” Hal cried. She was trembling hard, legs shivering, as strong waves of pleasure tore through her. Was she cumming? Was she pleasing? Was she doing things right? Did he want more? So many questions firing off in her mind, though she was too overwhelmed to voice them all. Her head fell back against Garg, her smooth pussy still seeking out more of his merciless attention, the little nub he’d been teasing still swollen, still wanting more. </div>

He wouldn&#39;t deny it, the way she came was just very hot, if he weren&#39;t so in control he would have made a mess in his pants just by hearing the sounds she was making.

He whistled then, somehow managing to make that kind of sound. &quot;Look at you go shadow girl. People would pay a fucking kings ransom just to hear your come like that.&quot; Good thing he wasn&#39;t a greedy bastard, but he was a selfish one and he didn&#39;t plan of sharing this hidden treasure he had just found. &quot;And fuck... Look at this, all for me...&quot; He pulled his hand from her pussy and dangled his soaked fingers in front of her eyes.

Again he manhandled her, practically throwing her on her back in the middle of the bed and taking off the rest of her clothes without a care. &quot;Fuck...&quot; He growled at the sight of her, &quot;And we are just starting...&quot; That was the small warning she got before he just shoved her legs over his shoulders and started to devour her sex. While his hands kept her hips steady, his cool tongue plundered her soaked pussy like it belonged to him. His sharp teeth were probably leaving small screeches in her flawless skin but he had warned her before, sharkins were rough lovers by nature. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Why was his teasing making her feel hot? And why was her body aroused even further by such words? Crude and possessive words! Truly, it was eye opening, Hal still quite confused, as to why her body would react as it was to any of this. She wasn’t wholly understanding what exactly was happening between herself and Garg, however... it felt right and her soft little whimpers would only clue the pirate in that she was enjoying every single minute. Craving more. 

“Yes sir...” Hal whispered, too delirious with pleasure to realize her words. They merely rolled off her tongue, her body pressed against Garg, while he held her tightly within his arms. When she finally lifted her head and saw her glistening juices dripping along his fingers, she felt her little cunt begin to pulse. There was that need again. Little contractions begging for something... anything... No. Not just anything. Him! Garg!

Still processing, Garg suddenly flung Hal down on her back, the headboard of her bed striking the wall with a loud thump. Whoever resided in the room beside her own, no doubt they heard it and more. Looking up at Garg, he removed the rest of her clothes, her top already a tattered mess on the floor. As he looked down upon her, she heard it. Predatory growls that made her heaving sex just drip even more. Suddenly, the pirate lunged in, his tongue lapping at her sex, teeth scratching her flawless thighs. “Nnnggg... god....” she cried out, hips bucking hard to meet his mouth. The girl didn’t even know such things could be done. But the way it felt with his mouth upon her, it was making her dizzy, leaving her wanting. 

“Ohhohhh...” Hal panted hard, that burn growing again. Before she knew it, that same strange feeling took over. Her body ready to burst. Suddenly, she was convulsing against Garg’s tongue, her juices flooding his mouth, while he relentlessly ravaged her otherwise untouched sex. “Nnngg... Garg!” She was sobbing, shaking, sensations making her body contort with pleasure. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Garg greedily filled his mouth with her floodings juises, becoming drunk in her pheromones. His tongue kept ravaging her sex, somethimes even shamelessly going lower and teasing her back entrance. His angry red eyes were focused on her face while his hands kept her hips steady because even if he was an asshole he didn&#39;t want her to accidentally stab herself on his teeth and bleed out on him, that would stop his fun.

As she kept writhing in pleasure and coming on his tongue he just kept relentlessly plundering her. His growls of enjoyment were the only things that could be heard from him. He was enjoying this so much that just for a second he bitterly cursed the sharkin gods in his mind, making the sharkin&#39;s mate with the first partner they found and curse himself for picking a fire genasi to do it. He&#39;s a water creature, that was just plain stupid.

Another moan from Hal made him dismiss nhis thoughts. He had enough, his dick was throbbing and he wanted to bury it in Hal&#39;s flooded pussy.

&quot;You make for a great meal shadow girl. Fucking tasty...&quot; He growled teasingly after finally pulling away and let her catch her breath. He even licked his lips and teeth, making a little show for her. &quot;Now it&#39;s time for the real fun to begin...&quot; He kneeled on the bed, looming over her like a predator nwhile his hands worked on untying his leather pants. At last his hard dick was revealed to her, while grey/bluish in color like the rest of him, it was surprisingly humanoid in shape.

After throwing his pants away one would think he would just start fucking her but where was the fun in that? He had too much fun teasing her so instead he started to rub hit too against her soaked entrance. </div>

Fuck, we haven&#39;t even kissed... What a kinky whore, all wet for the evil pirate.&quot; He even pushed a little of his tip inside her and growled at the feeling of her hot tight channel gripping him.

                    <div class="markdown">Hal was panting hard, her chest rising and falling, while her heart raced beneath it. She looked up at Garg, that predatory grin only arousing her further, unleashing these instincts she didn’t even know she’d had. It took this shark, this pirate, to awaken them. Licking her lips, she merely whimpered, hips desperately seeking him out, as he teased her. It was sheer torture! Absolutely cruel! Yet... she loved every bit of it. She scooted back a little, watching his massive form loom ominously above her delicate frame. Blue eyes meeting red, she was engulfed in his shadow, but shadows were always welcome with her.

Hands gripping the sheets, her legs spread and ready, it was hard not to focus on Garg’s cock teasing her entrance, his cool breath tickling her ear. “Nnngg...” Hal groaned, her sounds rewarded with a slight push, his tip causing her little cunt to stretch. The girl gasped loudly, just nodding at Garg’s words. Her mind spinning, as she realized that the whole time her body and soul had been waiting for... for this. It transcended what others might see as... natural. But, for the elf of shadow, this felt like it was what she’d been meant for. Destined for.

“P-please....” Hal suddenly begged, tears rolling down her cheeks, while her hips moved a bit, greedily seeking more. She then reached out for him, tiny hands gripping his arms, a means to just keep herself steady and grounded. As Garg slowly stretched her virgin cunt, she could feel the blood trickling, a sign that he’d broken her and had claimed her as his. It was raw and rough and exactly what her body demanded, her clit twitching and throbbing. The bundle of nerves so in need of the shark’s attention. </div>

How her body reacted to his rough touches and his dark words. As he spoke he kept slowly pushing his cock inside her, taking his time to savour how nice her tight cunt felt around his dick.

After he was completely inside her, he growled in pleasure, his body even shuddering a little. &quot;Fuck Hal...&quot; It was very intense for him, not only because he wasn&#39;t ruled by his instincts anymore but because he could feel how her body was a mess of signals, like a rough sea with waves crashing everywhere.

He remained there, unmoving. Getting used to everything he was feeling thanks to his missing heart, the lack of the vital organ forcing him to conciously process everything. &quot;Who would have thought that you had such a wild body under those clothes...&quot; He started again after getting a hold of himself. His hips started to move, slow, so slow like it was probably torturing her. &quot;I wonder what are you asking me with that <em>please</em>&quot; he mocked her a little before his tongue gave her neck a long lick, gathering all the blood that had accumulated there. &quot;Please stop? Please pull out? Or is it please fuck you like a whore? Please keep making you cum until you can&#39;t take it anymore?&quot; He chuckled then only the tip of his dick remained inside her before he gave there a hard trust and stopped moving. &quot;I&#39;m all ears... A captain need to listen to his crew wishes after all.&quot; </div>

The idea of her cunt shaping itself just for him... it made Hal’s heart flutter, her cunt heave with achingly strong desire. Her whimpers grew louder, the sounds easily making it to the hallways beyond her door. Looking up at Garg with need in her eyes, she couldn’t stop the tears from falling. The shark had overloaded her senses completely—one moment mercilessly taunting her clit, the next just denying her entirely. It was the sweetest sort of agony. 

“Please.... nnnggg.... p-please....” Hal’s mind was spinning, her body squirming, as he threatened to stop. She knew what she had to say. Those crude, yet delicious words. Words meant for no one except this shark hovering over her body. Her legs parted further, a small attempt to urge Garg’s cock home. An invitation to break here completely. Claim her entirely. “D-don’t stop.... please... please fuck me like a whore...” Her tears fell harder. “M-make me cum for you... until...” She was panting like an animal in heat, her little clit throbbing angrily, while begging for his attention. “Until my body can’t take it... break me, Garg......

Even knowing this was her first time he set a hard pace, his hands going to grab her squirming hips to make sure that he hit those sensitive points inside her he could detect with his special senses. He was planning on keeping his word to her because Garg fucking DreadStorm was no liar.

He pushed his face against her neck to lick more of that tasty blood her hers even biting her some more on the other less abused side of her neck and leaving his marks everywhere. &quot;Yes, that&#39;s fucking it Hal... Keep gripping me with that greedy pussy of yours... I&#39;m going to thoroughly plunder you to the point you can&#39;t stand it anymore... Don&#39;t hold back and keep cumming for me&quot; More and more filthy words were growled in he ear, aiming to completely overwhelm the elf. Fuck he had to admit it, she was an amazing fuck to the point he had to slow down sometimes to gather himself before renewing his punishing pace. </div>

Her hands reached for him, gripping him tightly, as he plunged deep and hard into her virgin cunt. Blood spilled from her, a surge of her juices dripping everywhere, making a mess. “Nnnn... Garg....” The shark’s pace only quickened, pain and pleasure one and the same. The girl howled loudly, like a needy slut craving to be fucked. But it ran deeper than that. On the surface lingered the vulgarity, the lewdness. But underneath those layers, she was now entirely smitten. 

“Nnnggg... Garg... fuck me, Garg! I need it!” Hal cried, her hips bucking furiously, while Garg’s crashed hard against her own. Wet smacks and powerful grunts made their way from room to corridor, the bed scraping the floor, as he claimed her. She felt him draw blood, his tongue lapping and tasting, her nails dig into him then, pulling him closer. 

“Garg.... ahhhh..... mmmmffff...” Hal was near speechless, Garg’s cock striking this spot that made her mind almost go blank. “I’m going to cum, Garg..... fuck, you’re making me cum again!” At that, her smooth pussy began to quiver her inner muscles gripping him hard, fierce undulations drawing him deeper, while her sobs filled the room and his ears. </div>

Giving her the punishment she wanted. &quot;Fuck!&quot; He roared with her. The sudden grip of her pussy triggering his own peak. But no matter what he never stopped his thrusting, fucking her through their orgasms while he filled her pussy with his cool seed. 

He slowed down eventually, allowing their bodies to calm down some but never actually stopping his hips. &quot;We aren&#39;t done yet...&quot; He growled ominously before he had a fun idea. Easily manouvering her they ended up like before, him sitting on the edge for the bed with her sitting on his lap and facing forward, only this time his hard dick was buried in her messy pussy.

&quot;I&#39;ll show yah what a filthy whore you are...&quot; He told her darkly before thumping his tail and summoning a illusion, showing them both sitting on the chair in a mirror like way. To add a little more to it he even tied up her hands with a scrap of there top and hooked them on his neck, forcing her to arch her back and her breasts to be more pronounced. &quot;Look at it.&quot; He growled roughly, a hand on her neck forcing her to see the mirror of them. </div>

She could feel his cool seed drenching her womb, the thought making her cum yet again for him. Gasping for breath, the shark then moved her around, turning her body on his lap before impaling her seething cunt once more. But he didn’t stop there. No. He bound her wrists and forced her arms about his neck. She was vulnerable and on display, his insatiable little slut that he could fuck and torment until her body was a quivering heap on the floor. 

Hal was a whimpering mess, her face stained with tears, her neck riddled with bites and scratches. Her appearance was made even more evident when Garg forced her to see just what she was with him when the doors were closed behind them. Her wounds and bruises were prominent marks. And none were discreet or would be easy to hide. As she looked at herself, her body bouncing on Garg’s throbbing cock, she knew no one would disbelieve her if she said she belonged to this sharkin. This pirate. Her predator. For she was his prey. Designed just for him. Panting hard, it thrilled the girl to see herself in this way. Completely unleashed and lost in her need. Her breasts bounced wildly, those wet sounds growing louder and louder. All the while her face contorted strangely with pleasure. 

“Garg...!” Hal cried, her body just moving on its own now, her twitching clit seeking that release she knew only the shark could deliver. “Nnngggg... fuck me, Garg.... fuck me...” Yes. She was begging out right, not caring how it made her sound, or made her look. “Your filthy princess needs you, sir... please... nnnggg...” </div>

Begging me to fuck her while already fucking herself on me.&quot; His hand never moved from her neck, forcing her to keep looking forward by squeezing her neck each time he saw her close her eyes.

&quot;My filthy princess?&quot; He kept tormenting her with his words. &quot;Aye... Smart... After this no one will come close... No one could make you cum over and over like this, making pain feel good... Only I can satisfy this greedy pussy!&quot; He moved his tail behind him, using it as leverage so he could start thrusting upwards, having to wrap his free arm around her waist to keep her from bouncing off.

Fuck, he could admit it, Hal was fucking wild in bed. He could feel her tight pussy milk him with every movement, uncaring that he had filled her already. Only wanting more. &quot;Fuck Hal... We will have so much fucking fun...&quot; Oh yes. Because he was a selfish bastard and even not being tied by the mating process of sharkins he planned to enjoy fucking her as much as he could. He had found that he liked sex but he still didn&#39;t plan to fuck around. Nah, now he had a nice pussy for that.

His movements kept getting rougher and rougher, forcing as much pleasure as he could out of her. &quot;Go on. Cum like this while looking at yourself. Show yourself how that greedy cunt milks out my dick. I want to feel that tight squeeze sucking my balls dry...&quot; He was shameless and enjoyed to much how she reacted to his filthy words to stop. </div>

The way she lewdly bounced upon Garg’s cock, her body battered and bruised, glistening with sweat. She looked like a wanton slut, a total whore howling in heat. Just then, she felt that burn. Her clit throbbing, while her cunt heaved and suddenly a surge of her juices sprayed her thighs. She was a sloppy mess, his filthy princess. And god how she loved every bit of it. 

“Ffffuuuuck.....” Hal howled, puddles of her juices just everywhere. What had this shark unleashed?

Hal kept her eyes fixed on her reflection. She saw the glittering rivulets of her cum running along her thighs, those thin ribbons of her juices tinted pink with her virgin blood, spilled just for <em>him</em>. Yes, Garg had broken her and no one would ever be enough. Besides, the idea of another made her insides twist, knot up in disgust. No. There was no one but Garg now. She was his. His lewd little elf, his filthy princess, his horny whore. She was his prey. Just... <em>his</em>. 

“Nnngggg... gods....” Hal panted, her breaths coming harder and harder, her little body reaching the brink of exhaustion. But her clit was still demanding, swelling and twitching, Garg’s cock hitting some spot deep inside that drive her mad with desire. “Garg.... I... I....” She was losing it, her cunt suddenly gripping his cock, sheathing him tight, while her muscles spasmed hard about him, another surge of her cum spraying forth. Eyes still fixed on the mirror, she was speechless. The vulgar display before her... it really was her. And it was a side meant only for Garg. Her captain, her predator. Pain and pleasure becoming one, a girl not only shadow marked, but marked by the only person allowed to see and touch her in this way. Marked by the sharkin. His own treasure, should he wish to keep her. And by the gods, she hoped so. </div>

Even he had a limit and Hal had just overloaded his sharp senses. He could feel her heart beating wildly in her chest, the hot sounds coming from her mouth urging him on to keep going and going. Fuck, he could even feel the waves of small electrical impulses firing from her sex every time he thrusted inside. 

And when she followed his instructions and started cumming like crazy he couldn&#39;t hold back either. One last powerful thrust and he exploded inside her again with a roar, another wave of his cool seed filling her up and making more of a mess between their legs. His mouth clamped around her shoulder then, an echo from those sharkin instincts he still was getting used to conciously control.

He stayed like that for a while, his eyes too never leaving the hot mirror sight that his magic had created and his chest rumbling with his beastly growls. He had to give it to her, this was the hottest thing he had done in his fucking life. 

&quot;Fuck Hal....&quot; He growled after finally releasing her neck, still feeling the aftershocks of that powerful climax. &quot;If it weren&#39;t for the fact that I can fucking smell it... I wouldn&#39;t have believed that you were a virgin...&quot; He told her while he started to lap her new set of marks. His hands released their tight hold on her and moved to her breasts, like any male he had fun just grabbing the pair of soft globes and playing with them. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Once more, Garg’s cool seed drenched Hal’s insides, coating her womb entirely. The girl shuddered with pleasure, her body trembling, as her clit twitched and yet again she was in the throes of ecstasy. “Nnnnngggg!!!!” she shrieked, looking at herself, at Garg in the mirror. The sharkin’s gaze was intense, his own desire for her making her grow hotter still. He then bit down on collar bone, blood spurting, her cries a mix of pleasure and pain. 

“More... more...” Hal begged, body bouncing, legs quivering. She wasn’t even sure she could stand after this. At least, not after some rest and maybe even some healing medicine. Not that she minded, the sight of them fucking like savage animals was enough to keep her going for the pirate. After a bit, Garg finally released his biting hold, the girl whimpering softly at the loss. To think she enjoyed being being ravaged in this way! She’d never have guessed, never have known! But something deep inside certainly did and it was heeding the call of this shark. 

“I don’t know what you’ve done to me... I didn’t know... it could be... like this...” Groaning, Hal tilted her head so that Garg had perfect access to the fresh set of wounds he’d inflicted upon her. “You make me feel... alive...” Just then Garg gripped her breasts, her pert nipples hardening into sharp peaks in his hands. His touches sent jolts of pleasure to her ruined pussy, making her squeak and gasp in his arms. “Nnnggg... Garg.... so sensitive... m-my nipples... nnggg... you’re making me need to cum again...” Once again, the little elf was sobbing, her little cunt undulating her pleasure, as she gushed for him again, like the dirty girl she was. “Aahhh... so sensitive...” she cried out, body convulsing uncontrollably, making her teeth chatter, her limbs twitching of their own accord. 

“P-please.... please, Garg.... m-mercy.... I... I...” Hal’s body was going limp in the shark’s arms, her blue eyes rolling back, as she just shook with intense jolts of pleasure. </div>

You beg me to stop but your greedy pussy keeps cumming on my cock... Sucking everything out of me.&quot; He finally dismissed the mirror illusion when he noticed that Hal couldn&#39;t keep paying attention anymore.

He had great endurance but even he had to admit that it was an intense fuck. Still he could torture her a little more while his dick was still hard, he thought and smiled evilly against her skin. &quot;I&#39;m a good fucking captain... I listen to the wishes of my crew... But... I would be a lousy one if I didn&#39;t encouraged them to push their limits, wouldn&#39;t I?&quot; As he growled his words  between licks and nibbles, one of his hands slowly moved downwards until he found her aching clit. &quot;One more... Cum on my cock one more time like the needy whore you are and I&#39;ll let you rest.&quot;

He started to touch her like he did before, this time the mess of their juices making everything hotter and messier. Even if he was trembling in his arms lost in pleasure he kept forcing more out of her. &quot;Go on, I know you have it in yah... Just feel that flooded pussy keeping my dick prisoner... This hungry little fella aching for attention...&quot; He gave her clit a small pinch then. At this point he couldn&#39;t detect the signals around her body, it was a like a stormy sea, too messed up. Each wave crashing against eachother in complete chaos but he knew she was listening to him. &quot;Cum for your fucking captain!&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">And the fearsome sharkin was hardly wrong. Hal’s tight little pussy was indeed quite greedy, swallowing down Garg’s massive cock without any care whatsoever. The girl had been begging for it, pleading, the moment the shark had broken her. Her cunt would never be the same again. For now it belonged to Garg and only Garg, her very own predator, the captain she’d now follow to the end. 

And Garg proved to be relentless. Hal had all she could do to hold herself up, her body sloppy with his cum... <em>her</em> cum... her sweat, blood, and tears. Bruises littered her porcelain pale skin, angry wounds lacerating her pretty body. Yet she’d loved every moment, every single mark. As the mirror vanished, she just groaned, a quivering mess that was spent and in need of a bath. Draped over the sharkin, she still heard his words, those demands. One more... just one more... His hands moved to her clit, fingers giving it a pinch. The pain immediately sent the girl reeling into several tiny orgasms, though finishing off with one large enough she just sobbed and sobbed in his arms. 

Hal’s head drooped forward, wild red curls all tangled and sticking to her pretty face in the best of ways. She was a vision to behold. A well sated slut who’d been fucked so thoroughly she could barely keep herself up any longer. While her juices surged one final time, her cunt milking Garg’s cock, thirsty for his cool seed, she tried turning her head to look up at him. Only she was now too weak and tired to manage, her arms still bound, her body still impaled on his cock. “Garg...?” she pleaded, her tone expressing something different now. A strange need she hadn’t yet shown since things erupted, a need she feared would be mocked and denied. At that, the tears just kept falling, her body shaking while she cried, going limp right there in Garg’s arms. <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="27-Jun-20 08:55 PM">(edited)</span></div>

Fuck, he was sure that if his body could cum again he would have, his cock throbbing in forced pleasure but unable to really climax.

He finally stopped torturing her body, instead he just kept his arms wrapped around her while she calmed down from the intense pleasure. He was not going to lie, he was feeling damned proud of himself for making her lose it like that. &quot;Fucking spectacular...&quot; He growled softly, still slowly licking her sounds.

&quot;What is it?&quot; He asked her, his growling voice sounding calm. He opened his eyes and noticed that she was crying, a different kind of crying that made him frown. The shark reached back with one hand and expertly summoning a shadow knife he cut the piece of cloth binding her wrists, allowing not only her arm to fall down but him to reach with a hand to turn her head so he could look at her face.

He stared at her for a minute, her weak body still held against him by his other arm and her cunt still impaled in his now softening cock. &quot;Well?&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">A flurry of emotions were swarming through Hal, as her body just shivered in the aftermath. Did he love her? Could he love her? Would he want her with him for all time? So many questions, her feelings so ragged and raw. She could still feel Garg’s arms about her, his low growling praises causing her lips to curve up just a bit, trying to form a sweet smile. Daring her to hope with all her heart. But the tears continued to fall, her vulnerability pounding in her brain. She found comfort in those small and probably unintentional gestures when Garg licked her neck, her collar bone. The girl longing to reach for him, to bury her face against him, while he just held her tight, a treasure he’d keep safe and secure. Forever. 

Weeping softly, Hal then felt him unbind her wrists, her arms falling to her sides. He turned her head, forcing her to look into his eyes, and it was then that she tried to reach for him, despite the way she was seated on his lap. No doubt Garg was confused, as Hal herself also was. But... Never had she felt more alive. Never had anything felt so right. Yet, she still needed that validation, that aftercare. She needed to know everything would be all right, that she’d done well and pleased him. Enough that... enough that he wouldn’t dismiss her. It was a scary thing to hope for, that romantic wish he’d teased her about before everything between them had happened. 

“I... I’m all right...” Hal began, still reaching for the shark. “Just...” She winced then, terrified she’d be denied. “Just... hold me a moment?” She was trembling, lips quivering. Her fear of rejection so very strong. “P-please? Captain...?” <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="28-Jun-20 04:21 AM">(edited)</span></div>

                    <div class="markdown">Garg raised an eyebrow at her words. &quot;I&#39;m holding you already, aren&#39;t I?&quot; He growled with a small chuckle. Still he was observant and noticed her weakly trying to reach for him and decided that he wouldn&#39;t mind indulging her after that great performance.

He easily turned her shuddering body around so they were chest to chest, the movement making him pull out his softening cock out of her and making him groan a little. He even gathered her weak arms between them and used one hand to hold her head practically tucking her in against him. It was a pleasant experience to say the least. 

As a sharkin physical contact was very limited for him, only being able to touch his parents without reacting like crazy and since he had lost his mate he had just forgotten about it... But now that he had gotten used to Hal&#39;s body he could secretly enjoy it, being a cold blooded adding another layer of niceness to it evbe if he wasn&#39;t a lizard and could move as fast in his cold environments as in warm ones.

Thinking about cold made him realize that she was probably cooling down too fast thanks to his cool body and he wasn&#39;t stupid, that could be bad for common humanoids so he let his body fall to his side and pulled the covers over both of them. He also enjoyed the warmth so it was a win win in situation in his mind. &quot;You know... I&#39;m a cruel pirate... But even I know that there are some things that shouldn&#39;t be messed with... If you&#39;re cold... You could&#39;ve just said something...&quot; He growled while lowering his head to push his nose against her neck, that picture of signals around her body blooming again in his mind. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Hal supposed that she deserved those taunts, her face falling a bit until she heard him... chuckle? She wasn’t sure what to expect now or what he would do. After all, how could anyone love a despicable creature who allowed injury to befall her family. She had no worth, and it was her life’s goal to find it. But then, Garg did the unexpected. He gently turned her small body around and... held her. The girl felt a strange warmth growing in her chest and more tears fell, her head now tucked against his cooler body. The girl closed her eyes, her arms just moving to hold onto him back. Was life truly granting her this? Perhaps a small step of many. 

Garg lied down, taking Hal with him and pulled the covers up over them both. Mere hours ago, she never would’ve guessed that Garg DreadStorm would’ve knocked down her door, the two of them making love, and now basking together in the aftermath. While her thoughts continued, her body so grateful for this simple act of kindness, she suddenly felt his nose brush up against her bitten up neck. Hal smiled, at the gesture, it somehow making her feel safe and desired and so many things at once. Overwhelmed and happy, she then planted a small kiss against Garg’s smooth skin, her grip tightening just a little. 

“Cold...” Hal mumbled, still smiling. “But... but alive and... perfect.” She hugged him tighter despite her bruises and wounds, and despite being an absolute mess. She would need a bath later, along with new clothes, as her others were torn to shreds. “Thank you, Captain. Thank you.” Again, she kissed his skin, nuzzling as close to the shark, as he’d allow her. The girl still wasn’t certain how all of this had been set into motion, but she was glad that it was and wouldn’t change any of it for the world. To many, it might’ve looked like she’d made a mistake—dragged into a brutal world... vulgar, rough, intense. But in her heart she knew, the right person had taken her virginity. The right person was now showing her the way. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Garg growled a little but didn&#39;t say anything, his arms tightened around her a little though, happy to leech off her warmth. This what different from what he had experienced with Ena. Things had been too fast and new for him and while the sharkin mating had taken place within him, she was too different... Not only their personalities, she always going back and forth and see mouth always saying something different from what he could detect with his senses... Even if they didn&#39;t work quite alright because she was practically an elemental, but their physical bodies too, she being literally made of fire while he was made for the water. With Hal he found that he enjoyed teasing and bantering with her since she wasn&#39;t always trying to tell him to stop being rough but instead tried to tease him back and even asked for more.

What most didn&#39;t understood about sharkins was that they were too ruled by their bodies. They did what they were made to do. And while he was still like that he was different now. His heart was only a organ with a function, a vital one but still a biological function. Now that he didn&#39;t have it he wasn&#39;t ruled by those &#39;attacks&#39; but he still could feel everything. He was happy to keep the facade of a &#39;heartless being&#39; but he could still feel, actually better than before since he didn&#39;t have those crazy hormones making everything harder to process. He still enjoyed making others fear him, to spread his tale, to feel the wind and salty water of the sea and thrived in it&#39;s dangers... And he also enjoyed the attentions of a woman.

He shook his head then, making his nose to rub against her neck harder. Whatever happens he would just fucking enjoy it, without any regrets. &quot;No need to thank me shadow girl... I told you, didn&#39;t I?&quot; </div>

Making soft and approving noises, the girl felt her face suddenly grow very warm. Rather than feel ashamed or embarrassed, she just nestled deeper against Garg’s massive, yet much cooler body. 

“First mate, Captain?” Hal stated, the title for Garg meaning so much more than the obvious. It made her tummy flutter, as she said it, her body molding against him, while they lied their in each other’s embrace. “I’d be honored. I do have shadow magic, Captain. It’s in my blood. I can try showing it to you if you’d like. Perhaps after I’ve rested some.” Of course, she’d need Garg’s help to learn how to navigate a ship, though the idea of learning from him... it appealed greatly. And more than anything, she wanted to see him happy and be able to be a part of why. “If I can help you make your ship fly, Captain... I promise you, I... I will.”

Again, Hal kissed Garg’s skin, her body cooled down and settled, thanks to his strange, but wonderful biology. And, of course, those subtle gestures her body and soul just responded to. “I’ll need to learn how to navigate it. Would you teach me, Captain?” she then asked, lifting her head a bit and looking up into his red eyes. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">The only sounds coming from Garg were soft growls, almost like purring but in a very shark like and scary way. All his life he had been on the move, the few times he had remained still had ended up badly for him... Even those short nights he slept in that bed while he was mated ended up bringing him bitter memories... But now... Well, he was actually enjoying it, mostly because he felt he was in control and didn&#39;t have to struggle with his instincts.

So he was happy to stay like that, feeling the warm body of Hal. &quot;Aye, first mate. You follow my orders and understood my plan to get out of that hurricane...&quot; He kept softly rubbing her neck with his nose, little by little he could start to see those signals again since she was calming down even if her body was still sensitive.

One would think that he would be one of those fuck&#39;em and leave&#39;em kind of pirate but in truth it took a real pirate to enjoy the quiet moments like this one, so he didn&#39;t mind her sudden clinginess, he enjoyed it even. &quot;I already saw some of your magic but a showing it all would be fucking great... Ha! If you impress me enough I&#39;ll let you have fun with my dick again...&quot; He growled with a chuckle and teasingly groped her ass again.

He looked back into her eyes, one eyebrow raised. &quot;Of course i&#39;ll teach ya shadow girl... A good captain has a capable crew and as the most experienced one it&#39;s his job to show them the proper way of doing things...&quot; </div>

You even are calling me captain in that sweet way... I like it but I liked how you screamed my name too...&quot; His tongue reaching out to lick her ear a little but then he stopped and pulled back with a laugh. He rolled a little on the bed, Hal still in his arms like she wanted until he found the perfect position so his fin and tail weren&#39;t being squeezed. &quot;So if you weren&#39;t reading smut, what were you reading?&quot; He asked after his now free tail bumped against a book but he didn&#39;t move to reach for it, happy to just hold her and Leach off her warmth. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">“Mm...” Hal sighed, enjoying the affection Garg was showing her. The girl kept her arms about him, holding on as best she could, and appreciating and relishing the closeness. “I do my best, Captain,” she added, nuzzling against him, while he continued pressing against her sensitive neck. “So I’ll do my best to not let you down.” 

Hal’s face reddened more, when Garg reminded her of what they’d done and shared. Of what could be if she was good and obeyed. If she continued to serve him well. Of course, she could now hear the light teasing amidst those growls and vulgar words. Something that made the red head feel a bit more at ease than before. Suddenly, the shark gave her backside a squeeze, Hal’s mouth opening only to let out a soft little squeak. “Eeep! Well, I... I hope your dick had fun with me...” she managed to say, her bright blue eyes looking right into his red ones. “You were a masterful teacher. I... I hope I was a satisfactory study at least. Though...” She swallowed hard, in a daze at the words she was uttering to the pirate. “Though I love to improve. So hopefully I get better n-next time.” 

At that, Hal buried her face against Garg, but it didn’t last for long. The sharkin brought up the books from earlier. The ones she’d hidden from his view. Just what would he think of her knowing she’d wanted to help him? It was anyone’s guess and she braced herself for the worst. “You... you’ll laugh at me,” she said softly. Though she reached for one of the books and brought it before him. “This one,” she went on. “This one is about Clocktower and other Wizarding factions.” The girl reached again. “And this one uhhh... this one is about beasts of the deep ocean. Your... your kraken is mentioned a few times.” Her tummy fluttered nervously. “And one more,” she continued, hands shaking as she reached for the third and final book. “This one is about... well, it’s... it’s about...” Her mouth was going dry, her nervousness growing. “It’s about sharkins.” <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="28-Jun-20 11:06 PM">(edited)</span></div>

She always tried to challenge him back while still recognizing his authority. &quot;Ha! Not only my fucking dick shadow girl! And already thinking about next time when you can barely move? Hehe...&quot; Despite his teasing, his body didn&#39;t move much, happy to just feeling her naked flesh against his own. He pushed his nose against her neck again and have her a couple more licks but otherwise remained silent until she started to speak again.

&quot;I&#39;m always laughing at you, aren&#39;t I?&quot; He growled softly, not really understanding why she was becoming all shy on him. He loosened his hold so she could reach for the books but his cool hands never left her warm body.
&quot;Boring... probably full of bullshit..... Ohh? Reading about me then? I guess you got the first hand experience but indulge me, what does it says? It&#39;s the first time I&#39;m seeing a book about my kind, most of our knowledge is passed from parent to child. Books don&#39;t survive long in the water...&quot; He closed this eyes and kept nuzzling her neck. Not curious enough to actually try to read the book for himself but still toned down his idle growls so he could heard her. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">The blood rushed to Hal’s face, her body heating up, while her tummy fluttered giddily. Despite that, she smiled, enjoying Garg’s manner of showing her affection and attention. She had to admit, she rather liked it and his action rewarded him with her little sounds of approval. The girl didn’t care that she was battered and bruised, still bleeding in some spots. In truth, it thrilled her, since it let everyone know she belonged to the pirate who held her. 

“Yes, Captain,” Hal agreed, still smiling. “You laugh at me often. Though I’m glad I can provide some level of amusement.” The girl looked up at Garg. “Perhaps this warrants special favor?” she then teased back, already aware that she now indeed had that, in a way. And in the way that mattered, at least to her. Proof was in the way he kept her close, kept teasing the flesh of her neck. Unable to help herself, she sighed contentedly and gave him her own affectionate squeeze. 

“As for the books? Well, I question the source,” Hal started. “So I’m actually curious to learn what’s right and what’s not.” Her smile broadened, blue eyes glittering with that innocent curiosity. “It did say sharkin are quite rare and among one of the oldest known races. So, I wondered if the historian took liberties, especially not being sharkin themselves.” The girl pursed her lips in frustration. “It did say that the sharkin capital city is called Sharanthis, apparently a very militaristic and battle heavy place.” She nuzzled Garg then. “So is it true you eat dragon?” she asked of him. “And is it also true that half breeds are even rarer than full?” One of her hands began stroking his skin, absently taking in that smooth and cool feel. </div>

We are one of the oldest races, the apex predator of the seas...&quot; He answered before rolling onto his back before sitting on the bed and taking Hal with him. &quot;Sharanthis... Wild place that one, full of assholes.&quot; He told her while looking into her curious eyes before finally releasing her from his hold. He cracked his neck before standing up from the bed and summoning his shadow clothes, this time he made them have pants and just reached out and picked up his leather ones.

&quot;Come shadow girl, grab some clothes but don&#39;t dress. I&#39;ll give ya your special favor and take you to the baths before we end up all dry and fucking sticky.&quot; He growled at her with a smile. Say what you want about a sharkin but they always liked to feel clean, to the point that even their breaths weren&#39;t foul like one would expect from a predator. He did enjoy how she smelled right now though but meh, he could make a mess of her later if he wanted. He offered her a hand to help her out of the bed, he wasn&#39;t sure how resilient elves were but he figured she would probably have trouble walking so as to grant her her special favor he would carry her there... And he enjoyed this physical touch thing too so it was a win win for him.

&quot;As for dragons, I haven&#39;t hunted one yet been busy leaning the business and all to go on that dumb hunt young sharkins liked to try. The old bastard says they taste good, lots of magic in the meat. Remember what I told you about your blood? Something like that but apparently stronger... Mom said they tasted like lizard.&quot; He told her while he waited for her to follow his instructions. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Hal swung her legs over the side of her bed, her muscles still rather shaky and weak. Luckily, her pack was next to her bed, so she pulled out a dress and then moved so Garg could scoop her up into his arms. She pulled the garment over her body, modest coverings at best, but it was something. Still weak, she flung her arms about his neck and just let her head rest against his chest. 

“Where I’m from there are dragons,” Hal explained, her voice soft and low. The girl turned her head then, planting tiny kisses against the sharkin’s skin. “But they aren’t common and...” Her voice trailed a moment, her words suddenly caught in her throat. “And my own parents are dead.” A few tears fell, as she remembered. Though she’d been very young, she still had a picture of them both in her mind. How she’d almost let her aunt replace them would always haunt her. And Keth! Oh god, her brother was still in that evil woman’s clutches!

Hal sniffled a little, burying her face against Garg, while the memories of her past raced through her head. “My brother is still alive. He... he... oh Captain, he’s in danger. And I don’t know how to save him. Will you help me come up with a plan?” She looked up at him hopefully. “I have to go back for him at some point. The Baron... she will hurt his mind, if she doesn’t just kill him.” 

Hal tugged on the dress she’d picked out, making sure it covered her most intimate parts from view. She wondered just where Garg was taking her, her hope was that it was for a bath. </div>

Fuck, he really made a mess of her, he thought with a growl and used the tip of his shark nose to rub those salty drops away. Better be safe than sorry and let another fucker think he was molesting a woman or something.

Garg noticed that she was still shaky just as he had suspected so he leaned forward and passed his arm under her knees to pick her up. &quot;There&#39;s no use in crying shadow girl. You want to plan a gig then we can do that.... Ha! I bet those stuck up fuckers will be scared shitless of seeing a real pirate in their pansy ass land!&quot;

With her body secured in his arms he started to walk out of the room towards the baths. &quot;If he&#39;s your blood I bet the fucker can be useful and I&#39;m always recruiting useful for my crew...&quot; And off he went, his cunning mind trying to take advantage of the situation but deep inside trying to distract her because it was one thing to make a woman cry in pleasure and another to make her cry for real. His momma taught him to be a decent pirate, a true pirate. </div>

The girl giggled a bit and moved to go fetch it for the sharkin. “Here you are, Captain,” she said sweetly before going to get something a bit more appropriate to wear around the ship. The girl still opted for a dress, something simple but pretty, yet also quite practical. She’d opted for a pale blue shift, the material light and flexible, perfect for a night about the airship. 

“This will do, Captain,” Hal said, holding up the dress for Garg to see. With a coy smile, she then pulled off the lounging dress and put on the blue one she’d been holding. Of course, the girl didn’t try to cover herself, giving the shark an ample eyeful, as she switched from one outfit to the next. Once dressed, she looked up at him. “Well? What do you think?” she asked. </div>

On the way he had been thinking on that raid they were planning but also half his focus was on the teasing sway of the elf&#39;s hips. He accepted the instruments with a small growl and then just dismissed his shadow clothing, only his leather pants remaining on him, and threw himself on Hal&#39;s bed while she changed.

He was about to start practicing with the pipes but most of his focus went away she she just undressed like that and gave him a little show. &quot;Looking good shadow girl...&quot; He growled lowly at her and it wasn&#39;t until she was done and looked at him that he started to move again. &quot;Looking good shadow girl.&quot; This time he said it more loud so she could hear before he finally brought the pipes to his lips and started to play one of his favorite tunes. One that he had hear on his old man&#39;s ship that was supposed to be the story of one of the first known pirates. Captain&#39;s gangplank song. It was a simple tune and while it wasn&#39;t perfect it was decent enough for a sharkin learning how to play the instrument.

When he finished he looked at Hal again and just grinned at her from his spot on the bed and tail slowly swinging almost teasing the hem of her dress. &quot;Well? Decent enough?&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Garg’s compliments had the red headed elf blushing, lips curved into a pretty smile just meant for him. She was glad he pleased, enjoying the view, as she turned this way and that in the dress. After a moment or two, she moved closer, listening, while he brought the flute to his lips to practice playing once more. 

“Oh, very good, Captain,” Hal said happily, moving closer still. “I’ve never heard that tune. Where did you hear that one?” she asked. As the girl asked her questions, she brought her hands up to Garg’s, like before, showing him how to best hold the instrument and properly cover the holes. He was doing splendidly, far as she was concerned. 

Waiting for Garg’s reply, Hal reached for a brush and began tugging it through her wild, fiery tresses. While brushing her hair, she moved to sit next to the sharkin, but not before leaning in to kiss what would be considered his cheek. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">In this short time they had spent together Garg has becomed so ued to Hal&#39;s touch that he didn&#39;t jump anymore, just felt the small shockwaves of her own nervous system and her warmth which just made him growl a little. Still, he didn&#39;t do anything to stop her from freely touching him instead he just kept playing while she got ready.

&quot;That is the legend of one of the first known pirates. Captain gangplank and his ship deadly. The death pool... Most fuckers think that is only a tale, that no one really knows the beginings of piracy... But that&#39;s the ship my old bastard is commanding, so we know the legend is real.&quot; He told her before trying to finish up the song while she brushed her hair. After she sat down besides him his tail just curled up around her, landing on her lap and letting her feel how heavy it really was, probably because it was pure muscle and bones. Whether it was intentional or not Garg seemed unaware of that gesture reserved only for mates and children. A fact that Hal may have read about in that book.

After he was done playing, he pocketed the pipes besides his trusty compass and then crossed his arms over his chest. &quot;We can search for the helm of this ship. I have never looked at it, and it will have a good view to use the sextant once the stars go he fuck out...&quot; He growled while looking at the colorful strips of cloth hanging over the bed. He was curious of how this ship was controlled... Say what you want about Garg DreadStorm but in the bottom he was a little sailing nerd, he knew about legends, ships, the sea... Fucking yeah. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Hal quietly listened to Garg, as he told her more about the tune that he’d played. The shark might not realize it, but she was certain a musician was somewhere underneath that rough exterior, just longing to shine and share that love of song. She smiled then, her blue eyes suddenly moving to her lap. Garg’s tail had settled itself against her lap, while wrapped about her body possessively. It was an intimate gesture in every way, and she tried recalling what that book in the library had said. From what she could recall, the shark’s actions were a declaration of sorts, even if he wasn’t openly stating as much. 

Just then, a pleasant heat washed over Hal. For the first time in a while, she felt like she belonged. Like she was wanted. Loved. Garg still hadn’t said as much, but his actions seemed to say what his words did not. Setting down her brush, she then shifted a little, her hands daring to touch his tail, petting him gently with her delicate yet nimble fingers. 

“Well, then let’s search for it,” Hal encouraged. “The more we learn about the ship and I learn in general, then the better we will be when we go to Castle Ellorenthi. Keth will need all the help he can get. I just hope he’s all right.” </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Garg growled softly when he felt Hal&#39;s hands on his tail but didn&#39;t move, just kept laying there while staring at the ceiling. &quot;Can you draw a map of that fucking castle, shadow girl?&quot; He asked her after a few minutes. What she said made him remember that important detail. Unlike that island, the castle will be crawling with elves and while he didn&#39;t mind a good fight, the shadow squid could only carry a small party with provisions and some cannons.

While he waited for her answer he just kept thinking. About that raid, about the other job where they would get the cannons and about this ship they were in. He would admit it, Hal had a good taste in beds. It also helped that the whole thing and Hal herself still smelled like both of them thanks to all.that fucking they had been doing around.

He suddenly jumped off the bed before he fell asleep like a fucking pup and shook his head. Then turned to look at Hal, his cool hands just pulled her into her feet while he growled at her. &quot;Let&#39;s get going shadow girl, you look fancy enough already. Lead the way... I wanna see how good your sense of direction is and if you can find what you want like a good pirate.&quot; And then waited for her to do as he commanded. </div>

It might be worth their while. Still, she nodded and answered, “I’m not much of an artist or map maker, Captain. But I’ll do my best. If needed, I can look for a cartographer to help me make one.”
The girl smiled at Garg, hands continuing to pet at his tail. 

When Garg got up, Hal moved to stand up as well, hands smoothing her skirts, while biting down on her lip. “I think it’s all right. I’ve had many successful missions back in the Feywild. Still... land and sea and even sky are all very different things indeed. But hopefully I can grasp things without too much difficulty.” She was hopeful, though nervous. Though regardless, she would do her best. Ready to try a bit more, the girl walked out of her room, closing the door behind Garg, and then making her way down the corridor and towards the <span class="mention">#cockpit</span> . </div>

She turned so that her back faced it, and then bumped her backside against the door, causing it to open. Once inside, she held the door open with her foot and waited for the Captain the enter. Once they were both inside, she’d close the door and set down her tray on a small table. In the wardrobe, she reached for a robe and put it on, her body shivering just a little since her hair was still wet from the pool. Once the robe was secured, she sat down on one of her chairs—a small sofa—and hoped that Garg would join her. </div>

Even then he had to give it to her, she knew how to move as quietly as possible... Maybe he could learn a thing or two from her so he could easily surprise the fuckers that crossed his path.

After they were both inside he followed her example and put his food on the small table. &quot;Ya cold shadow girl?&quot; Garg asked as she out on the robe, after walking half naked around the whole place he guessed that she was only covering up from the cold and not his eyes. Garg just chuckled and squeezed his bulky body on her small sofa with her, it was always awkward to use normal seats thanks to his tail but he didn&#39;t let that stop him since he found that he enjoyed touching the elf&#39;s warm body. His tail ended up curled around Hal, rudely taking half her seat as she was pushed forward on her seat.

Garg just growled happily and picked up his tray to happily start eating the half cooked meat. &quot;So that fucking secret language of thieves... How did a princess end up learning underground fuckery?&quot; </div>

With the cozy robe about her body, she felt better, and hadn’t meant to upset the Captain. “Yes, just a little. I’ll be fine soon enough,” she said, giving him a warm and sweet smile. As she shifted a little to grab a slice of apple and some cheese, she felt Garg’s tail bump her forwards, her tiny body almost slipping off the small sofa. “Ooff...” she grunted, but the Captain’s tail kept her in place, the gesture just making her blush a little. 

“Thieves’ Cant?” Hal then reiterated, her words more rhetorical than anything. She munched on her snack and then swallowed it down. “Well, I was raised in a house that prides itself on its espionage. My aunt had me trained and taught by her elite inner circle. They taught me infiltration and stealth. How to use a crossbow and see into the ethereal plane. They also taught me thieves’ cant and how to speak without using words at all.” The girl’s blush deepened. “But anyway, Thieves’ Cant is a strange language. It requires nuance. Making very specific facial expressions and gestures when you speak. A different gesture with the same word can have an entirely different meaning. Here... let me show you,” she explained. 

Hal turned to face Garg, her lips moving, while she spoke some strange sounds, her hands moving fluidly, but with purpose, her eyes blinking twice, while her forehead crinkled. “I just said... this is how someone speaks in language of thieves... can you see how many things go into learning it?” The girl then smiled up at him and said something else using those strange sounds and gestures. “I just said... Captain Garg DreadStorm of the Shadow Squid. Feared pirate and Boogeyman of the seas.” </div>

&quot;So that&#39;s what it is... I think I have seen it in action before &quot; He growled as he thought about it while still eating his meat, analyzing the strange way that Hal made gestures to communicate. Then it clicked in his mind, somehow, someway he could see it! &quot;Fuck I get it!&quot; He cheered suddenly.

Then he lowered the tray of food onto his lap so he would have his hands free. &quot;Of course the Boogeyman of the seas gets it...&quot; He growled, some some syllables some sounding a bit different than normal, he also tryied to do some of those strange gestures, it was a bit difficult thanks to his shark features but he managed. While saying something different he had barely managed to say &quot;Like this shadow girl?&quot; In thieves&#39;cant. It was no near as refined as Hal managed to do it but it was a start.

After he was done, he picked up another piece of meat and started chomping on it. A wife grin obviously on his face, feeling proud of himself as a pirate while he waited for Hal&#39;s verdict on his performance. </div>

Yes, it would take a little work to refine his skills, but he seemed to already be over those hardest of hurdles. 

“I’ve honestly never seen anyone pick up the language and gestures so easily,” Hal praised. “It’s a lot to take in and understand. I suppose it’s why they prefer you learn when younger.” It made sense then, as to why the Baron had stressed that she and Keth listen to the elites and take the time to learn it. It had also paid off more than once. 

“You’ve dome very well, Captain. It will be easier now that you recall the core of the language.” Hal just smiled, pulling the robe tighter around her body, hair still a bit damp. “Before long every pirate and thief will think you’ve been speaking the cant your whole life.” </div>

Of course they fucking will!!&quot; he cheered a little after Hal&#39;s last words before he calmed down again and started to eat again. &quot;I have seen it before... But was too busy learning other shit to pay attention to that secret language...&quot; He told her between bites, finishing his meal before he reached for the jar of fresh water and took a big swig and washed it all down. The rest of it he poured over his head, specially over his gills and then pulled everything away.

He had noticed that Hal was still cold and growled a little before he stood form the couch and moved towards the fireplace. Even if he was a sea creature, he knew how to lit a fire even in the wettest environment, how would you fire a cannon otherwise?

&quot;Idiots thing that sharkins are dumb beasts like them but we are one of the oldest races for a reason... A good hunter trains both their body and their fucking mind... I don&#39;t forget easily, I use everything I see to my advantage. That&#39;s what a true pirate does shadow girl, be stronger than your enemies, faster than them, smarter than them... Because the moment you find someone better than you that&#39;s when you die like an idiot.&quot; He growled at her while he worked up the fire, his voice more serious than before. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Hal smiled inwardly, as she watched Garg make his way to the fireplace and easily start a fire. As soon as the girl heard those crackling flames, she curled up on the sofa and tugged the robe tighter. In that moment, she wanted nothing more than for the Captain to scoop her up and hold her. Of course, she’d be lying to herself if the idea of being held by the shark didn’t send thrilling jolts along her skin, those pleasant sensations settling nicely between her legs. 

It honestly was as though the Captain had awakened something deep and raw and primal within the elven girl. Hal had never known her body could experience such intense sensations or... or even react in the way he seemed to always provoke. Suddenly, the girl blushed and just sighed softly, whiled curled up and cozy. 

“Thank you, Captain,” Hal said. “You’re far from dumb. I witnessed how you handled everything back on the island remember.” She gave him a sweet smile then. “And look how quickly you recalled thieves’ cant.” She was practically beaming with pride for him. “I plan to get myself fully comfortable with the water,” she went on. “I hope to pick things up even a fraction as quickly. Same with those tools you showed me. We will have to keep practicing. I really want to do well.” </div>

                    <div class="markdown">After the fire was roaring and quickly warming the room, Garg finally turned around and saw Hal getting all cozy by herself on the couch. Garg growled a little but didn&#39;t move, letting the fire warm his body. What most didn&#39;t know was that sharkins didn&#39;t care about cold or hot because their bodies temperature was the same as the ambient around them, so after a little while he stopped feeling the difference.

He grinned at her words. &quot;With me as your captain, y&#39;all get used to water fucking fast shadow girl... But you can&#39;t never forget that no matter what, you aren&#39;t a sea creature....&quot; He told her and shamelessly untied his leather pants/shorts and let them fall, leaving himself completely bare to Hal&#39;s gaze.

Then Garg took a few slow predatory steps towards the elf. She seemed to be done eating  so it was time to have some fun. &quot;This is a lesson I learned from my mother...&quot; He growled as he grabbed her waist and pulled her onto her feet in front of him. &quot;Never remain with wet clothes if you can avoid it or they will suck the heat out of you and make you fucking sick.&quot; And without asking permission he started to pull everything off her. She would feel that his body was strangely warm, as if he had absorbed lots of heat from the chimney just so he could warm her up.... In more ways than one. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Hal sighed softly and nodded. Yes, it was true. She wasn’t a sea creature. No matter what she did, she would never be like her Captain and would always be vulnerable once in the water. Even still, she wanted and planned to be the best that she could given the circumstances. 

At that, the red head looked over at the shark, his large body approaching her once he’d finished with the fire. Hal felt a tingle run down along her spine, the look in Garg’s eyes giving her a small thrill. Just then, he pulled her body close, his hands removing her clothes. No asking... just doing. The girl just stood there, letting the Captain do as he desired. Once fully naked before him, she felt a dull throb between her legs. The shark moved closer then, a strange, yet delightful heat emanating from his body to hers. 

Hal looked up at Garg, her pale skin still bruised and marked. She licked her lips in anticipation, her nipples going hard, as that ache between her legs began to grow. Suddenly, she whimpered softly, a needy sound filling the otherwise quiet room. </div>

He looked down at her and grinned, licking his teeth. &quot;Now... Time for the desert...&quot; He growled at her slowly.

Yet he didn&#39;t attack her like before, like a predator enjoying the hunt he grabbed her hand and pulled her with him closer to the fire. He had noticed that her red hair was taking a while to properly dry out and he would do nothing with a sick first mate and since his magic was more about freezing people and getting them wet, it was of no use here.

The sharkin went for Hal&#39;s neck, giving her a sensual lick, tasting her soft skin while his hands went for her ass. He shamelessly groped her while pulling her hard against him, making her feel his hard body... And his very hard cock too. &quot;Very tasty... &quot; He growled in her ear before he effortlessly hoisted her up so he could roughly kisse her in that awkward way in that was becoming more familiar they more they did it. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">“Mmfff...” Hal grunted, as Garg pulled her close. He wasn’t gentle, but his actions were not intended to harm. Despite his rough handling, the red headed elf felt very safe and inwardly at ease. She trembled slightly when he licked her neck, his cool breath teasing her heated skin. It wasn’t out of fear, nor was she overly cold. The shark’s close proximity was enough to keep her warm right then and there. 

Garg’s growls, that predatory stare. It was enough to rile Hal, to get those juices that seeped from her sex to flow steadily along her thighs. Looking up into the shark’s red eyes, she knew he could sense her arousal, the aroma of her seething cunt overloading his senses and making her more vulnerable by the second. She was right where he wanted her, sharp teeth barely grazing the sensitive flesh of her neck before he finally kissed her hard, leaving her breathless and in desperate want. 

“Garg...” Hal begged. “Please, Captain...” Her little clit was throbbing, pulsing along with every rapid beat of her heart. She was certain he enjoyed this. Enjoyed that a simple touch or look could get her into this heady state of blissful delirium. She spread her legs for him then, her way of presenting herself... prey submitting to its predator and relishing the moment entirely. </div>

Still he didn&#39;t push inside, instead he teased her with his cock. &quot;What do we have here first mate?&quot; He growled teasingly as focused on rubbing her needy clit with the head of his cock and using her juices to lubricate himself. &quot;Is this my payment for the swimming classes?&quot; He kept teasing her, enjoying how he could make this elf princess become a needy whore in his arms.

&quot;You are like powder... Fuck... Keg... Always ready to go off...&quot; He growled as he lowered her down on him, joining their bodies as sheating himself completely inside her. &quot;Always ready to take your captain...&quot; He managed to growl as he closed his eyes and returned to licking and nibbling her neck, not moving yet, taking his time to just enjoy the warm embrace of her cunt. </div>

While he mercilessly teased and tainted her seething entrance, she just whimpered like the needy whore she was. “I... I can’t help it, Captain,” she then whined, her hands moving to his shoulders to help him balance her better. 

“Nnngg...” Hal groaned, her thighs dripping like crazy, when Garg finally pushed his way home, his cock easily sliding into those tight depths of her needy little cunt. “Nnnggg... fuck....” she cried, her hips already adjusting, trying to find that perfect angle. Just then, she felt him slide along those sensitive spots. Those spots that made her body shiver, her skin tingle. Those spots that turned her aching cunt into that waterfall of ecstasy only her Captain could manage to provide. 

“Oh my god...” Hal sobbed, thighs quivering. The girl didn’t know what it was or why. But her body just responded to the shark’s in a way that always left her speechless and dumbfounded. She held onto him more tightly, savoring the way he licked and tasted her flesh. But she couldn’t stop her body.

“Fuck.... Garg....” Hal cried out, her body already succumbing to pleasure, convulsing on his lap, his cock gripped tightly by her undulating, yet flooded, pussy. Her juices were everywhere, making them wet, while her hips began to gyrate, her need only growing, as he held her. “More, Captain... please more...” </div>

His chest was rumbling with his beastly growls as he enjoyed the amazing feeling of being inside the elf&#39;s cunt. It was hot, wet, a true treasure... One that was only his now. &quot;Fuck first mate...&quot; He managed to growl as he felt her walls squeeze him, his hard dick throbbing as her hips starting to move in that sensual way, looking for more of him.

With her arms around his neck, his own arm around her middle and her legs wrapped around him, he used his now freed hand to roughly grab the back of her head and pull her for another rough strange kiss. &quot;Patience is an important trait for a pirate... A pirate is a predator.... And predators take their time until it was the perfect moment...&quot; He growled at her between kisses, unlike before Hal would feel that his body wasn&#39;t cool, but warm. Thanks to the fire, his overall temperature had risen, making it a different experience for her. 

&quot;And when you do... You pounce!&quot; He growled as he roughly pulled his hips back until only the tip of his dick remained inside her, it was amazing how her greedy cunt gripped him like an octopus wrapped around it&#39;s prey, and then thrusted with force. &quot;Fuck!&quot; Was the only thing he could say as he repeated the process a couple of times before once again stopping completely inside her and continued growling in pleasure. </div>

This denial was brutal, sheer torture, while he continued to wait, watching her body squirm with utter desperation. The girl was sobbing, her little cunt pulsing hard, begging he go deep and claim the tight channel. Her womb was his and his alone. And right then and there, she wanted him stuffing her full, filling her up. Making his sticky seed mix with her pussy juices and smear along her thighs. 

&quot;Nnnggg....&quot; Hal whimpered, arms clasped about Garg&#39;s neck. Her lips were swollen from his rough kiss. And her quivering clit swelled and throbbed, needing him to pounce and take what was his. Just then, he rammed himself deep, causing the red head to cry out, pleasure and pain and all things pleasure. She was in ecstasy, hips moving faster to meet Garg&#39;s ferocious thrusts. &quot;Yes, Captain...&quot; she panted, a prey in heat for its predator, presenting itself for the taking. &quot;P-patience...&quot; Tears flowed freely, staining her pretty face and mixing with that fine sheen of sweat. 

&quot;Feels so good, Captain...&quot; Hal rasped, her hands gripping Garg tightly, nails digging his newly heated skin. His mere touch was enough to set her off, but this... This joining of the flesh, this rough and raw love making where they could unleash their lust and passion... Each and every time it sent her into this heady oblivion, a place where only the two of them existed. A place where she knew she only belonged to him—her Captain. </div>

Like a predator running after the prey, Garg started to fuck Hal with deep powerful thrusts making them both feel intense raw pleasure. The overflowing wetness between Hal&#39;s legs making everything easier and better for the shark. Lewd sounds of their bodies slapping together soon overcame the one of burning logs on the background so only the sounds of their fucking could he heard.

&quot;Of course... it fuckin does...&quot; The sharkin managed to say between growls of pleasure as he kept her firmly in his hold, his powerful muscles easily taking the weight of the elf and his heavy tail providing for the perfect counterbalance so the captain could keep fucking his first mate right there, standing in the middle of the room, in front of the burning heat of the chimney.

His angry red eyes never left Hal&#39;s face. He really enjoyed how he managed to bring this trained spy to let go of everything until the only thing she could think about was how good he was fucking her. The more tears fell from her eyes and cries escaped her mouth, the more intense his thrusts became. In and out, a simple pair of actions was the only thing he was doing. Nothing else was needed to make both of their bodies to explode in raw pleasure.

When he felt her hot cunt start to clamp on him, he quickly tightened the grip on her hair and pulled her face closer to his, forcing her to look into his eyes. &quot;Yes Hal... Fucking patience...&quot; He roughly growled at her never stopping the movements of their hips. &quot;The longer the chase..... Fuck!.... The sweater the reward...&quot; He told her, ordering to keep holding on and building that pleasure. He wanted to enjoy his dessert, take his time with her and fuck her thoroughly. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">”Nnnggg god...” Hal groaned, her slim body bouncing roughly against Garg’s cock. In and out, he impaled her deeply, his tip striking home against her cervix. The girl yelped in pleasure, breasts jiggling wildly, while he continued these rough and dominating actions. “Mmmffff... don’t stop, Captain... I... I...” She was sobbing hard, shaking violently, while he continued to fuck her tight pussy. 

Again, Hal’s body reacted, falling over the edge, as Garg’s cock continued its relentless assault. Over and over, he was stimulating that sensitive spot, that spot that made her cunt gush for him again and again and again. She let out scream, pussy milking him hard, while her muscles convulsed all around him, drawing him deeper still. 

“Captain... shit...” Hal lost all filters every time it got like this. Her senses frazzled and reeling, her body Garg’s to taunt and tease. Still, her hips kept moving, those slaps of flesh mixed with that wet slurping sound of her greedy little pussy filling the room... and more. Anyone near the room would never doubt that she was being ravaged and fucked by the shark. “I’m cumming, Captain.... I’m cumming for you... nnnggg...” </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Oh yes, Garg was truly enjoying himself while ravaging Hal&#39;s body. The shark was literally drunk on her, all his sharp senses overloaded to the point he could only kept moving his hips and nothing but wild growls and snarls left his lips. The more her needy cunt gushed warm juices for him, the harder he kept fucking her. 

When he felt the elf start to shudder around him, Garg tightened his grip on her and practically roared in pleasure. Hal&#39;s greedy cunt milking him in that amazing way, so good that like like a ship trapped in a vortex, he couldn&#39;t stop himself from being pulled with her and start cumming himself. Despite the intense pleasure, the sharkin managed to keep roughly thrusting, fucking Hal through their climax... Until he couldn&#39;t anymore and just stilled completely inside her and filled her up with his warm cum like her greedy pussy wanted.

&quot;Fuck Hal....&quot; He managed to say after a minute as he pushed his nose against the place where her neck met her shoulder, his own body shuddering in pleasure as he kept filling her up and her everything kept overloading his sharp senses. <em>Well, that certainly had been intense, like all their other times fucking.</em> Was the only thing he could think in that moment, his mind still swimming in pleasure. Good thing that the first thing a pirate learned was how to keep standing despite everything, otherwise his balance would have failed him and they would have stumbled into the floor like idiots. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">While Hal all but convulsed around Garg’s cock, the girl just held tightly onto him, feeling that final thrust, along with the eruption of his seed. By the gods, it felt so good when he fucked her and filled her tiny womb with his seed, her insides completely drenched in his cum. It was oozing along her thighs, creamy cum mixed with her own juicy puddles. Her body was twitching, those little jolts still coursing along her body, as both of them stilled and just basked in the moment. 

Hal tilted her head when Garg pressed in against her neck. The girl wanted him to have access, enjoying the feel and the closeness. His touch sent her to places she couldn’t explain. Then, did it matter? Hardly! Her Captain just gripped her tightly, as if demanding she were now a part of him. And, in a way, she supposed she was. 

“Mmm... god...” Hal whispered, legs wrapped about Garg’s waist. Her hands then caressed him and she pulled back just enough, looking deeply into those strange red eyes. The red head smiled then and gave him a kiss the best way she knew how. Their story was a bizarre one. But as she remained there in the sharkin’s embrace, she was glad they had a story at all. And to think it all started with stealing a ship. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Garg remained standing where he was in front of the fire, easily holding Hal thanks to his great strength and balance. His senses were still overloaded by the amazing feeling of the elf&#39;s body wrapped around him but when she offered him more access he instinctively started to lick her neck, tasting her between growls as he slowly regained control of himself.

After a minute he took a couple of steps back, chuckling a little after hearing Hal&#39;s whispers. &quot;Not a god shadows girl... Garg fucking DreadStorm...&quot; He growled at her. But yes, he could understand the sentiment since that had been fucking intense.

Guided by his tail, he found the bed without looking and tightened his grip on her even more before he let himself fall back on Hal&#39;s soft bed. A small, &quot;Fuck!&quot; escaped him as all of their combined weight landed on his dorsal fin, making it bend in a spot were it wasn&#39;t supposed to. Yet he didn&#39;t release the elf from his grip, instead he just rolled over a little so his fin would be more comfortable, yet the thing still throbbed a little. &quot;Fucking land dweller shitty beds...&quot; He grumbled to himself, &quot;This place need&#39;s a fucking hammock, the ones with holes...&quot; Those were the only comfortable things he could use to sleep while out of the water and be on his back, otherwise he needed to lay on his front or sides so his tail and fins were comfortable.  &quot;My fin&#39;s not broken, ain&#39;t it?&quot; Garg asked Hal, since she could easily reach behind him to check, and returned to his previous task of nuzzling Hal&#39;s shoulder. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">”Ooff...” Hal grunted, when Garg fell back onto the bed. He was warm and hard beneath her soft body, but that was hardly unpleasant. Rather, she enjoyed the way she fit against him, like a puzzle piece that had finally found its mate. For a brief moment, the girl laughed at their little predicament, but it was cut short once she realized something was wrong. 

“Captain?” Hal squeaked, worry in her voice, as she separated her body from his to better inspect the potential issue. Garg had rolled them over to the side, her hand working its way down his back. The girl wasn’t quite sure what had happened or how serious, but hearing that hint of fear and concern in her Captain’s voice was enough. She gave him one final nuzzle before crawling around to see the spot that now worried him. 

A mix of cum and juices dripped along Hal’s inner thighs, her little cunt still pulsing from their previous love making. But the elf, now concerned for her Captain, put those thoughts out of her mind and gently touched Garg’s back, her fingers eventually finding their way to his now sore dorsal fin. “I’m not sure how bad it is,” the girl admitted. “Perhaps we should have one of the healers take a look in the <span class="mention">#med-bay</span> .” The girl then climbed off the bed and began reaching for some clean—and dry—clothes to put on. “I’ll feel better if it’s looked at. Please, Captain,” she then begged. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Garg growled both in pain and annoyance. Pain because yeah, fuck, his fin was probably broken. And annoyance because he secretly wanted to cuddle with Hal a little more... But he was not a whiny bitch so he just rolled over his front to give the elf easier access to check him, not even caring that she was crawling all over him. That part was kind of nice, specially since thanks to the mess between her legs, she smelled like him.

As soon as Hal&#39;s fingers touched his fin, he couldn&#39;t avoid the growly &quot;Fuck!&quot; That escaped his chest, despite her light touches. Yep, it was probably broken. He thought as he remained there, just growling in annoyance and was about to tell Hal that he would just sleep it off and let it heal when she suddenly begged him to see a healer. He was not stupid. He knew the could probably use some bandages... And until it was healed, swimming would be painful. 

&quot;Fuck...&quot; He grumbled as he stood from the bed and went to out on his pants. &quot;But if one of those motherfuckers start touching me I&#39;m going to stab them...&quot; He growled in warning and was about to cross his arms over his chest but stopped, obviously wincing in pain since the action stretched the skin on his back a little. Grumbling to himself some more, he took a deep breath, putting the annoying pain aside and focusing on his nice Hal smelled all filled with his cum. &quot;Alright, let&#39;s get moving then...&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Hal finished pulling on nightdress, the thin material draping over her otherwise bare body like liquid. She then pulled back on her robe and put on a pair of slippers. The girl watched Garg pull on his pants, his face working hard to conceal his pain. She frowned a little and then put her hair up into a sloppy sort of knot, wild red tendrils framing her pretty elven face. 

“Come on,” Hal said softly, reaching for her Captain and tugging him along. She knew he needed more than the mere superficial aid she could give, so the sooner he saw a healer... the better. And she didn’t like the idea of him being in any sort of pain. “Let’s hurry.”

Hal could still feel that mess from their love making smeared all along her thighs. Barely covered with no panties on, the wet mess just lingered on her skin and pooled inside her little cunt. “I don’t think it’s far and best to get proper treatment sooner, right Captain?” she prodded. “Even Captains know it’s best to get good treatment lest their injuries cause unexpected complications later.” She nuzzled his arm, while tugging on him. “Not a bad thing at all, Captain. Shows good sense and judgment.”

Smiling sweetly, Hal gently kissed Garg’s arm and led the way to the <span class="mention">#med-bay</span> . </div>

I have had worse... but It was a good idea shadow girl.&quot; He told her as he took off his only piece of clothing and threw it on a chair.

The shaking smiled, completely without a shame and walked towards the elf. &quot;A good sleep is what I need for the fucker to heal. You wanna help?&quot; He asked her teasingly as his hands reached her and started to pull on her clothes. &quot;Take these off. We have a busy day tomorrow and I want my first mate sharp.&quot; He explained as he helped her to take everything off, leaving her completely naked and smelling amazingly like him thanks to the mess between her legs. 

Then his arms pulled her small frame against his muscular one and he nuzzled her a little. Still, the pirate&#39;s touch was less sexual than before. Instead, he just wanted her to get naked because he enjoyed feeling her bare body against his. &quot;Come on shadow girl...&quot; He growled at her as he released her and went for there bed, laying on his front so his damaged fin and his tail would be comfortable. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Hal felt her skin grow warm, as a rush of red bloomed along her otherwise very pale flesh. The girl lowered her gaze and gave into Garg’s possessive tugs. Obliging the shark’s demands, she helped him further remove her clothing. Fortunately, there wasn’t much in the way—just a robe and a thin nightdress. Soon enough, the fine fabrics were nothing but a puddle of clothing on the floor by her feet. 

As soon as Hal was free from the offending garments, her body was pulled close and she just relished the feel of Garg’s cool frame enveloping her own. She nuzzled him back before he let go and moved towards the bed. With a sweet smile, the red head followed, and situated herself in the bed beside him. 

“I’m here, Captain,” Hal whispered, her hands moving to check on Garg’s wounds. “Are you sure you’re all right? Do you need anything?” The girl could still feel that mess between her legs, her thighs and cunt completely drenched in Garg’s scent, his seed. “Perhaps in a little while I can apply more medicine and rewrap your fin. The healer had said we should later this evening.” Her smile grew and she lied down then, cuddling close and partially draping her body against his. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">The tired and hurt sharkin growled pleased when he felt Hal get on the bed with him. More growls, practically purrs, made his whole body rumble as her naked body touched his. His tail slowly wiggling from side to side, it&#39;s cool skin caressing her legs with each pass. &quot;Do whatever you like shadow girl...&quot; He answered, giving her free reign. It was no a thing he did lightly. As a Captain and a sharkin. After all, lowering your friars like this, always got you stabbed on the back. Such was the life at sea... But, he trusted Hal so for once he could relax and just let his body rest.

He really enjoyed how she smelled like him after fucking around the whole day and made a mental note to always keep her like that. Yes. That would tell any predator that the shadow girl belonged to him, the boogeyman of the seas. The pirate with the scariest crew and ship.

That line of thought made him remember something. &quot;We need to buy more of those supplies...&quot; He growled as he grabbed one of Hal&#39;s pillows and made himself comfortable. &quot;One pack for you and a couple to have on the ship... And to find those weapons too.&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Hal snuggled beneath the blankets and cuddled herself closer to Garg. “Mm...” she sighed, when the shark alluded to purchasing more of those healer’s kits. They certainly seemed well worth it, and practically a necessity on this raid they were planning. She’d have to see about getting some to have on hand. 

“What sort of weapons were you thinking about, Captain?” Hal then asked, a bit curious. She preferred her crossbow above any weapon she could wield. Though perhaps it might be good to get some specialized bolts. She could also try concocting some poisons. Remembering some things Ettrian had taught her before the Schism, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to test out his recipes. 

“I can try making some poisons,” Hal went on. “My friend, Ettrian, taught me before I’d left the Feywild. If we lace our weapons, it might be helpful. What do you think?” she then asked. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">Garg kept making those deep relaxed growls. His eyes were closed and his body would have been completely still if it wasn&#39;t for the slow wiggling of his tail. He did open and eye when he felt Hal&#39;s body stop touching him and noticed that she had moved under the covers so with an annoyed growl he did the same, only this time he moved practically on top of the woman and rested his head on her soft breasts. &quot;Fucking better than that pillow...&quot; He grumbled and closed his eyes again.

It took him a few minutes to answer but eventually he did. &quot;We need cannons... Maybe a big ass ballista with an harpoon too... The shadow squid is a fast ship, so we need the smaller lighter ones, we will have less fore power but longer range.&quot; He explained and happily cuddled Hal&#39;s breasts while practically purring.

Then after hearing her other ideas he opened a single red eye and raised his head a little to at her face, a sleepy but still evil looking grin appeared on his own. &quot;Poison huh?... I like the way you think shadow girl..... If you can make it one of those nasty ones that feel cold and paralyze... Even better.&quot; He growled at her and nibbled softly one of her nipples, a little tease, before he settled down again and closed his eye. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">”Oh...” Hal mumbled, only slightly startled at Garg’s sudden actions. But she settled quickly, feeling his body snuggle close to her own, his face practically buried against her soft, yet supple breasts. Absently, she began caressing the back of his neck and head, the closeness making her body tingle and feel warm. 

“Yes,” Hal then spoke. “My friend Ettrian had shown me some things before leaving the Feywild. So I’ll see what I can do and just what it is I might need.” Her words were cut short when Garg taunted and teased a nipple, causing her body to shudder beneath him. If he wasn’t careful, they’d soon be lying in a messy puddle of her juices, the shark just able to stir her body in the most primal and raw of ways. 

It was almost embarrassing how easily Garg could get Hal off, make her body cum again and again, while her pussy just flooded with her juices. The girl had never known her body was capable of such things. Then, she’d also never thought anyone could ever love such a creature as she. Love... a strange and powerful word. Did Garg actually love her? The shark often boasted he was free of such things, having no heart thanks to the kraken’s dark magic. So, was he no longer capable? Or, was it something else. A part of the girl was terrified to no for fear that this idea of love was only just in her head. 

“Captain...” Hal then started, after a moment or two of silence. She could feel the soft growls against her breasts, nipples standing at attention, as goosebumps formed on her flesh. “Are you... are you able to love?” she asked, face suddenly growing quite hot. “I mean, you said you were free of such things once before. So... are you unable to love then? Is there nothing you love at all?” She closed her eyes then, fearing his laughter or worse, knowing she wouldn’t be able to take a rejection. </div>

                    <div class="markdown">As soon as Hal started to pet him, the sharkin&#39;s chest started to softly growl again. Her actions making him instinctively nuzzle into her, the two little holes at the tip of his nose, blowing out his warm breath onto Hal&#39;s chest. Little by little Garg could feel sleep claiming him. Nice... He thought, since it was so hard for him to sleep out of the water.

It seemed that being like this with Hal, allowed him to lower his defenses to be comfortable enough to rest. His arms wrapped around the elf body, securing her in his grasp so his new pillow would not move and not so secretly enjoying the simple contact of his skin with hers.

Hal&#39;s words barely registered on his mind. What was she asking? He wondered for a second. Able to do something? He could do anything... He was the Boogeyman of the sea. &quot;Yes...&quot; Was his sleepy answer before he finally fell asleep, his body needing the rest to start repairing itself and regain his lost energy since it has been an eventful day. Leaving the poor worried woman hanging, giving her only a tease of a true answer. </div>

After everything with his fin, she supposed she wasn’t all that surprised. But his words... he seemed alert enough to answer, but too fatigued to properly elaborate. 

“What, Captain?” Hal then asked, delicate fingers still lightly grazing along his neck, his head, taking care to avoid his injured fin. “What do you mean?” But all the girl heard was those light growls, as he buried his face against her bared breasts, their bodies fitting together beneath the blankets. He was asleep. And given things, she decided it best not to wake him, though her heart ached for a definitive sort of answer. 

Clamping her eyes shut, Hal allowed herself to rest sink deeper into the bed, her hands never leaving the shark’s skin. “Well...” she sighed, her chest tightening just a bit. “I love you, my Captain,” she then whispered, before letting herself drift off to sleep in the arms of her Captain. </div>
